I've set up a React+Cloudfront+S3 SPA. Cloudfront has an OAC and the S3 bucket policy only allows CF to access the contents of the bucket. All public access is blocked. The bucket is configured for static website 
enabled
. There is an 
index.html
 and 
error.html
 configured and those resources exist in the bucket with those names.


Bucket Policy






Problem


All of this works. I can visit my CF url and see the react application. However, if I attempt to access some non-existent resource in the bucket (for example 
https://xyz.cloudfront.net/foo
, I get the following error:



<Error>
  <Code>AccessDenied</Code>
  <Message>Access Denied</Message>
  <RequestId>VZEPZ2TPB5HX0W2V</RequestId>
  <HostId>2MmWdKGa13rUK0YTsQ+5GJPJnEgzJNvuLV+qL0Soc/taJpMaV4yd2+gVdvfIa5cjVtiZwNgUXDg=</HostId>
</Error>



Why is this not returning my 
error.html
, as configured for the S3 bucket?
