Hello,


So I am trying to push an image created from ADO pipeline.
The push is failing saying

USER_X is not authorized to perform: ecr:GetAuthorizationToken on resource: * with an explicit deny in an identity-based policy


The org is et up as the following:


Root
   > Accounts
       > Org 1
       > Org 2
       > Org 3



I am unable to change the above :(


root has IAM setup and configured and this is were my user ("USER_X") sits, full admin access.


I have an ECR setup in Org2 (for example), I created a policy following an example which is stated as allowing cross org. and contains the following:






However this does not allow my to do anything.


Any ideas or help is greatly appreciated
