I'm trying to upload a file using StreamManager Export function. But the upload failed with 
403 Access Denied
 error message shown below:




I am aware of that StreamManager with S3 export requires the following policy, according to 
Greengrass V2 Developer Guide






Here's a portion of my IAM policy for the 
GreengrassTokenExchangeRole
 which should cover the requirements above.


{
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectLegalHold",
                "s3:PutObjectRetention",
                "s3:PutObjectTagging",
                "s3:PutObjectVersionTagging",
                "s3:Abort*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<my bucket name>/*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
},



Why did I still get access denied error?
