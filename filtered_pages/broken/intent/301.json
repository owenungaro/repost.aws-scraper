I used this CloudFormation template to create my ECS Cluster 
https://tomgregory-cloudformation-examples.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins-for-ecs.yml


I am using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) / Fargate Jenkins plugin.


I am trying to configure Configure Clouds but when I input the region 
eu-central-1
 where I created my cluster it spins and spins and cannot list my cluster (it times out with error 504 in the browser console). I am 100% sure my cluster is located in 
eu-central-1
 but when I select this region it doesn't find my cluster. What am I missing?


UPDATE

I looked at CloudWatch logs and I found that it's permissions related


User: arn:aws:sts::{...}:assumed-role/jenkins-role/5d8e46aed4f642809856ffa57732588a is not authorized to perform: ecs:ListClusters on resource: * because no identity-based policy allows the ecs:ListClusters action (Service: AmazonECS; Status Code: 400; Error Code: AccessDeniedException)



I added a policy to the role with this statement






I've confirmed in Policy Simulator that the role does have permissions to list ECS clusters but it still doesn't work.


This is the response from AWS IAM API
