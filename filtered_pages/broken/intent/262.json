Hi,
So i have a use case,

users are reflecting in AWS from AZure AD which I have added to application. all seems fine as assigned users also able to login with my sso URL to AWS account


but I want to allow each user to switch role when they logged in to their AWS account


I have tried to give trust relationship as below:






but still when I am trying to login to role ,  I am not able to switch,
can some please help me on how can I achieve this??


So, on high level, I want to make my user switch role after they logged in to aws account using identity center URL but not able to switch getting error,
"Invalid information in one or more fields

I am using external identity provider as Azure AD in my IAM identity center
