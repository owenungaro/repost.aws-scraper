I have an IAM role with full access to my s3 given the permission


"s3:*"



I am trying to use the s3 batch operation to copy some files from my buckets back to them while adding encryption to the files. So first I have added the batch operations trust relationship below into my IAM role in order to run my batch operation jobs and triggered some jobs for different buckets.






For my surprise, although I had no issues with most of my buckets, for a few buckets the batch operation failed. when I checked the report containing the error, I got this for the objects that could not be copied


Anonymous users cannot copy objects.  Please authenticate. (Service: Amazon S3; Status Code: 403; Error Code: AccessDenied



Here are some additional details about my setup:




All buckets have ACLs disabled.


All public access is blocked.


The IAM role is used to trigger the batch operation jobs and it works for some buckets but not for others.
