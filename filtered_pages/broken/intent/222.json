hi sir,


I have to use iot core device advisor to get the aws iot core qualification, now I meet many problem, so I'm trying to solve it one by one.


I'm following the 
document
 to set policy of IAM in
IAM-->Policies-->Create policy


I modify the example contents to my account Id







now the policy editor return me some red error word:


Ln 4, Col 8
Missing Resource: Add a Resource or NotResource element to the policy statement. Learn more


Ln 7, Col 25
Unsupported Principal: The policy type IDENTITY_POLICY does not support the Principal element. Remove the Principal element. Learn more


what's wrong with my json?
