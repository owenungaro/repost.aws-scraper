hello. i've been trying sending realtime video stream through raspberrypi with webcam to kinesis video stream and want to transform it and save the continous images(not a video). i checked the youtube video from AWS iot (

,

) and successed getting video stream from raspberrypi to kinesis video stream(Iot core certification). But, the thing is i followed instruction and it cannot connect with S3(cannot save images in S3 bucket). i've double checked the role and policies which is same as instructions.


{
    "StreamName": "rt-video-1",
    "ImageGenerationConfiguration":
    {
     "Status": "ENABLED",
     "DestinationConfig":
     {
      "DestinationRegion": "ap-northeast-2",
      "Uri": "s3://dining-images/rt-video-1/"
     },
     "SamplingInterval": 2000,
     "ImageSelectorType": "PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP",
     "Format": "PNG",
     "WidthPixels": 640,
     "HeightPixels": 480
    }
   }







are these all information where kinesis video stream and S3 bucket is connected? please tell me where might be wrong
