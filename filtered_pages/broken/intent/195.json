Hello,


For an AWS Application, I tried to create a tag-sync. The Console Screen (added below) requires to 
Select a role that has permission to tag all of the resources that you include in the application.
 I've manually created the role with below Trust Relationship and permissions, and selected it in the screen. But sometimes I got an error about Trust Relationships of the IAM Role, and sometime the screen freezes, and never makes the tag-sync.






Permissions:




ResourceGroupsandTagEditorFullAccess


ResourceGroupsandTagEditorReadOnlyAccess


ResourceGroupsTaggingAPITagUntagSupportedResources






Could you please specify how should the Role look like so that the tag-sync to work ?


Thank you,


Mihai ADAM
