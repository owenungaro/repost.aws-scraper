Hello there AWS team!


I'm using provision by claim in AWS IoT core to provision a fleet of devices.


At this moment I'm able to publish to $aws/certificates/create/json topic and receive the following values:
-Certificate Id
-Certificate
-Private Key
-Certificate ownership token


Now, I'm trying to publish to 
$aws/provisioning-templates/esp32_fleet_prov_template/provision/json
 topic. I get the following error in the 
$aws/provisioning-templates/esp32_fleet_prov_template/provision/json/rejected
topic:
-{"statusCode":400,"errorCode":"InvalidParameters","errorMessage":"Cannot resolve reference value: SerialNumber"}


As far as I understand, I need to create a JSON with the ownership certificate which is what I do here:


    DynamicJsonDocument registerDoc(2000);
    registerDoc["certificateOwnershipToken"] = ownerToken;
    char jsonRegister[2000]; 
    serializeJson(registerDoc, jsonRegister); // print to client    
    client.publish("$aws/provisioning-templates/esp32_fleet_prov_template/provision/json", jsonRegister);
    registerDoc.clear();



My policies are:
esp32_claim_policy (for the claim certificate)







esp32_fleet_policy


{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iot:Connect",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:sa-east-1:195542078145:*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iot:Publish",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:sa-east-1:195542078145:*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iot:Subscribe",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:sa-east-1:195542078145:*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iot:Receive",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:sa-east-1:195542078145:*"
    }
  ]
}



I couldn't find the documentation for the JSON on the AWS site, so I'm following this one 
https://buildstorm.com/blog/aws_iot_provision_by_claim/

I think I need to add a serial number and certificateId in the JSON?
I tested different formats but all of them result in the same error, so I muss be missing something, but I can't find too much documentation about it.


Thanks a lot in advance :)
