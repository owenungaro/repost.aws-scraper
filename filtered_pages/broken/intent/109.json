I have an EC2 instance with (OS) Debian 11 installed and I'm having problems connecting using the EC2 Instance Connect endpoint where it shows the error


Failed to connect to your instance
Error establishing SSH connection to your instance. Try again later.


I made all the necessary settings like:




IAM (user)


Permissions ( user )


Endpoints


instance region


Choice of AMI id


Instance type ( t2.micro )


Key Pair


VPC id


sub net id


Security Group Id




Below is the configuration of permissions to establish connection with the instance, in Json format, and also follows the rules defined for SSH connection:


Custom Permission






Rules ( Security Group )


... IPv6	HTTP	TCP	80	Custom   ::/0	â€“
... IPv4	HTTPS	TCP	443	Custom   0.0.0.0/0
... IPv6	HTTPS	TCP	443	Custom   ::/0
... IPv4	SSH	TCP	22	Custom   177.16.108.18/32
... IPv4	HTTP	TCP	80	Custom   0.0.0.0/0


0v0 ( I don't know if OS Debian 11 is compatible with the EC2 Instance Connect endpoint, maybe that's why the error is happening, thanks to anyone who can help me ).
