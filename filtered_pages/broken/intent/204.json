Assuming I have an ID token of the following format:


{


  
"sub"
:
 
"..."
,


  
"email"
:
 
"email@example.com"
,


  
"custom_claim"
:
 
"value_here"
,


  
"name"
:
 
"..."
,


  
"at_hash"
:
 
"..."
,


  
"sid"
:
 
"...."
,


  
"aud"
:
 
"...."
,


  
"exp"
:
 
0
,


  
"iat"
:
 
0
,


  
"iss"
:
 
"..."


}


Is there a method of using the "custom_claim" claim inside of the Trust Policy for an IAM Role? There's been many use cases for this (CI pipelines in GitHub/GitLab is a big one among others), but there doesn't seem to be support for it.
