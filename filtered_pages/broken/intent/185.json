Hello, I need to configure a policy to apply to aws organization accounts.
Requirement 1: AcceptDataGrant action must be allowed only among accounts of the same organization and must be denied from accounts not part of the aws organization.
Requirement 2: the aws organization payer account must be able to send/receive DataGrants to/from any aws account, regardless of being part of the organization or not


we tried a couple of options, shown below, without success


{
"Effect": "Deny",
"Action": "dataexchange:AcceptDataGrant",
"Resource": [
"*"
],
"Condition": {
"StringNotEquals": {
"aws:ResourceOrgID": "PRINCIPALORGID"
]
}
}
}
