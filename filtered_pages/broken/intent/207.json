Hello,


I'm trying to run from Athena a command to generate an Iceberg table like below (main purpose: register S3 table bucket catalogs in Athena)


CREATE TABLE default.temp_table (id bigint, data string, category string)
PARTITIONED BY (category, bucket(16, id))
LOCATION '<warehouse location e.g. s3://<uid>--table-s3>'
TBLPROPERTIES ( 'table_type' = 'ICEBERG' )



but I got an S3 access error: 
Access to the specified S3 resource is denied, please check your IAM/S3 bucket policies and any relevant KMS permissions


I've tried the below policy on the S3 bucket, but I have same error:






Could you please specify how should look the S3 permission for such access ?


Thank you,
