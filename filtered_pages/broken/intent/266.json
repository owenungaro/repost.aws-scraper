AWS Honeycode API service call from AWS Glue python code using boto3 is giving issue.


Sharing the code snippet below:


import boto3

honeycode_client = boto3.client('honeycode')
response = honeycode_client.list_tables(workbookId = 'eb59751e-ef06-4de0-a4a9-c355e49308ab')



NOTE: workbook and tables are already created in Honeycode. Role applied to glue job is having below policies:

    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "honeycode:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*",
            "Effect": "Allow"
        }
    ]
}



Above code snippet is giving below error:


AccessDeniedException: An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the ListTables operation: Team is not associated to an AWS Account


what extra access is required for above mentioned access issue?
