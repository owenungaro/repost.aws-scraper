I am trying to configure my IAM policy which would allow a user to only view the bucket and place objects, delete and update the folder/files within that bucket, but deny bucket creation. I have already added the following to my IAM policy but it is of no use as it will still allow the user to create a bucket. How to achieve this goal?


	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		,
                {
			"Effect": "Deny",
			"Action": "s3:CreateBucket",
			"Resource": "*"
		},
		{
			"Effect": "Deny",
			"Action": "s3:CreateBucket",
			"NotResource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
		},
		{
			"Action": [
				"s3:ListBucket",
				"s3:GetBucketLocation"
			],
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket"
		},
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"s3:GetObject",
				"s3:PutObject",
				"s3:DeleteObject"
			],
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
		}
	]
}
