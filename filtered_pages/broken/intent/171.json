Hello,


I'm looking into SCPs, and I see that's possible to require a tag for EC2 for example with the following policy:





But what in case when I want to create a policy which would deny creation or any modification of any resource when it doesn't have tag Project. Can I simply use wildcard for action and resource, like below?


{


      
"Sid"
:
 
"DenyResourcesWithNoProjectTag"
,


      
"Effect"
:
 
"Deny"
,


      
"Action"
:
 
"*"
,


      
"Resource"
:
 
"*"
,


      
"Condition"
:
 
{


        
"Null"
:
 
{


          
"aws:RequestTag/Project"
:
 
"true"


        
}


      
}


    
}
