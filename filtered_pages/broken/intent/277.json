Hi AWS, I am writing an SCP to enable 
AWS Config
 and 
AWS GuardDuty
. The approved regions are 
us-east-1
, 
us-east-2
, 
us-west-1
. Here is the SCP code:






But during testing, I tried to enable both AWS Config and GuardDuty in one of the non-approved regions (for e.g. 
ap-south-1
) and I was able to enable it.


Can you please help me in identifying why it is happening?
