I created a service role with the following trust relationship:


    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        
    ]
}```

When I try to use this role to create a Firehose Delivery Stream, I get this error:

`Firehose is unable to assume role arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/myservicerolewithexternalid. Please check the role provided.`

I assume this is because the Firehose service is not passing the external id when trying to create the Deliver Stream.  Strangely this DOES work if I set the external ID in the trust relationship to be the AWS account number, but no other external ID seems to work.

How do services  (specifically  Data Firehose) pass an external id when trying to assume service roles?
