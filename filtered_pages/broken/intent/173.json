I was reading the 
AWS documentation
 explaining how to create the CodePipeline service role. However, I don't understand why it needs the following statement:





inside the 
RolePolicy.json
 file.


I am 
not asking for explanation
 of what 
iam:PassRole
 is and why and when we use it in general. I understand that it allows a principal to pass a role to another service. However, I'm confused about why we need it particularly inside the CodePipeline service. So,


Q1: What is the principal, what is/are role(s), and what is/are service(s) in this case?

Q2: Isn't it insecure to use 
"Resource": "*"
?
