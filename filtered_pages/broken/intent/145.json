Hi, I was trying to implement a system on AWS. The system has one account A (not root) in an organization.


Problem
: Account A has an S3 bucket and I need to create a Glue Crawler to read S3 data.


Encountered error:
 Glue Crawler refused to be created due to the error "Account *** denied access" on Account B.


Attemp
: I have already disabled SCP for the organization. Glue's role was attached with these policies: "AWSGlueConsoleFullAccess", "AWSGlueServiceRole" and this custom one:






Glue's role has already allow trust relation with glue to assumerole as well:


{
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "glue.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }



If anyone has been through this scenario or has encountered the same issue, please help me with this.
Thanks for the help.
