I follow this tutorial :

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/cer-annotation-pdf.html#cer-annotation-pdf-set-up


At the step "Creating an annotation job", I get this error :


botocore.exceptions.ClientError: An error occurred (ValidationException) when calling the CreateLabelingJob operation: The role ARN arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxxxx:role/xxxxxxxx-SageMakerExecutionRole-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx isn't valid. Make sure the role exists and that its trust relationship policy allows the action "sts:AssumeRole" for the service principal "sagemaker.amazonaws.com"


So, I went to IAM and check the trust relationships :


        



Is that enough ?


I'm using the Ubuntu app under Windows 10.


I checked the version of boto3 :


# pip show boto3
Name: boto3
Version: 1.26.52
...



What can I do more ?


Thank you in advance !
