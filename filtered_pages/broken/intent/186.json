I don't know what I'm doing wrong here (Resource and Principal are modified to protect privacy). The erorr message I get is: The resource policy isn't valid. Check the policy format and try your request again. I've tried asking both AmazonQ and Bing AI, but they give me contradicting information; I am aware of the Policy Generator, but i'm pretty sure that's only for IAM Management Console. My business partner is an IAM User in IAM Identity Center, not IAM Management Console, and I have no experience with editing resource based policies.


I'm not sure if I should deal with this or just publish my Lex bots prematurely, so he can help me with edting the bots. Nobody has responded to my previous question I submitted here a month ago, and only with constant trial and error along with reviewing documentation and getting help from Bing AI and AmazonQ was I able to resolve that issue. I sadly am only on the free support plan, so I can't directly ask AWS staff themselves to help me with my particular problem as much as I want to smdh (unless I pay but I won't).


UPDATE: I've been informed by both AmazonQ and Bing AI that even if I were to add my business partner as an IAM user, set up the permission set, and attach the necessary policies, he still can't fully access the Lex bots while they're still in draft mode. I've also been made aware that IAM and Identity Center are completely separate services and AWS might deprecate the former eventually. Therefore, I think I'll just publish the bots prematurely in Lex and then theoretically my business partner can fully access them as I did everything right in Identity Center.
