Hello,


when I open the carbon footprint usage on the billing page the values are zero. I think this is not very realistic, because we were running big virtual machines.
I added the sustainability rule to my IAM Role:






My user has Billing and Adminrights as well. Our account is using start-up credits. Any idea why it shows values of 0? The account exists for over two years now, so the time horizont should be fine?
