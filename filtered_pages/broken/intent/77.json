I have this SCP attached to account A in my org:





As I understand:




the SCP will deny if each and every record's type in my request equals A or AAAA


the SCP will not deny if at least one record's type in my request is not equal A or AAAA




However, when I create R53 records in account A using the console:



the SCP still blocks the request even though the request contains a record of type "CNAME" which is not A or AAAA


What is wrong in my understanding of this "ForAllValues" ? Please help me. Thanks
