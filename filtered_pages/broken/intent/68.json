I have a lambda function which is supposed to write files on s3 to a folder in a bucket


I set this IAM role to the lambda function:






So it should be allowed to write to the "uploads" bucket, into the "Images" folder, right?
But it won't work, meaning the image is not written on s3.


However, if I add "AmazonS3FullAccess" which is the AWS given policy, it works.


So the question is, what does S3FullAccess have that my restricted policy doesn't?
