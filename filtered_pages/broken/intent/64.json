I have an SNS topic for the ChatOps and I configured Slack to send messages via sns. The test message is working fine.
Now Im creating a response plan in the incident manager to send the message to Slack. But which I click on save button Im getting the following error.


There was an error in creating the response plan.
Topic policy does not allow the service to publish to these SNS topics: arn:aws:sns:ap-south-1:xxxxxxxxx:AWSChatBot-Incident-Manager



But as per the 
Incident Manager Doc,
 I have added the following line into the SNS access policy.






Not sure where is the error.
