Hello


We would like to constrain VPC Peering to stay within an OU.


We created the following SCP:






I know this SCP is effective, because it does DENY the VPC Peering connection if the Org Path is incorrect.


However, this does NOT work when the Org Path is correct: it still allows cross-OU VPC Peering.
I think the reason is the command is running in 
this
 OU even though its connecting to a VPC in another OU.


CLI:


aws ec2 create-vpc-peering-connection --vpc-id vpc-123456 --peer-vpc-id vpc-987654 --peer-owner-id 1234567890



Note: the CLI command is not stopped since its only looking at the invocation of the CLI and not interpreting the arguments.


Any suggestions on how to prevent cross-OU VPC Peering with Org SCPs?


Thanks in advance!
