Hi, I am experimenting the possibility to authenticate S3 file download using S3 URL, right now, I used HTTP Gateway that has a HTTP Integration that GET the S3 Object using S3 URL. Currently the bucket blocks all public access, I would be wondering if that's possible to write a bucket policy to allow API Gateway to access the object using the object URL from that integration. I tried this policy statement, but it seems it doesn't work, and I still got access denied
