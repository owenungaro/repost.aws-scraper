Hi,


What about if the user assumes the role and the policy is applied on the STS trust level or the destination? For instance, I have a user who logs into the system with MFA credentials, gets the access creds + token, and then tries to assume another role that can operate on something. What is carried exactly to STS that can be used for the verification?


I am having trouble verifying whether the user has a token assigned to it during trust verification.
The STS policy is like:







And should be enriched with:


          "Condition": {
                "Null": {
                    "aws:TokenIssueTime": "false"
                }
            }



But when I do, then it stops working. Any ideas?


Regards
