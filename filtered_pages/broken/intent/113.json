Let say i have an aws account A of Organisation A from where the 
Identity Center users
 login and can assume roles using the policies (trust relationship estableshed from these target account) to other aws accounts into another organisation B.


crossAccountPolicy in account A of organisation A
 -> 
assume roles in accounts of organisation B


I know using the permission set with type customer-managed policy, but how do we establish the trust relationship in the accounts of organisation B?


What i tried:
in the target accounts of organization B, i specified in the trust relationship policy of the assumed role

I tried the one from below also, but unable to switch role from the permission set [crossAccountPolicy  - assigned with this policy]
