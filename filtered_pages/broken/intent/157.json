I'm trying to make changes to a Route 53 hosted zone in one account (Account A), from a different AWS account (yep – Account B). The two accounts are enrolled in the same Organisation. We use IAM Identity Center to sign in (so not vanilla IAM).


I have edited the permission set for the Identity Center user, with an inline policy to allow access to the Route 53 hosted zone:





However, I keep getting permission denied errors:


% aws route53 get-hosted-zone --profile staging --id <zoneid>


An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the GetHostedZone operation: User: arn:aws:sts::<account-b>:assumed-role/AWSReservedSSO_AdministratorAccess_<etc>/<identity-center-user> is not authorized to access this resource


I've checked the user is correct with 
aws sts get-caller-identity --profile staging
.


The same request from my Identity Center user signed in to Account A (
aws route53 get-hosted-zone --profile develop --id <zoneid>
) works as it normally would, with a description of the zone.


As a sanity-check I also made a role in Account A to allow a trust relationship with the Identity Center user, and group, and account root, but still get the same error.


… which makes me wonder if there are some Route 53 wrinkles that make x-account access a bit trickier. AWS 
seems to think
 it should be doable though!


Will appreciate any guidance, thank you.
