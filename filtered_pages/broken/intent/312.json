Hi AWS, the IAM users in our AWS accounts are mostly having AWS managed policy 
AWSAdministratorAccess
 attached to it which allows it to access all the AWS services and performs most of the read/write action if not every. We need to restrict the users from decrypting the KMS key, so the easiest and fastest deployment I thought is to add a 
Deny
 section for KMS Decrypt API by modifying the 
AWSAdministratorAccess
 policy and attach a newly modified customer managed IAM policy. Here is the code:






Please acknowledge and confirm if it is the right way of doing the things or is there a better way like using an SCP etcetera. Also confirm if I use this policy will it going to work or not?
