Hi,
I need my account to perform actions on behalf of another account.
Please, could you tell me how to do it? I am trying to create trust policies in both accounts:




The main one, called as AccountID A, should have a trust policy with the following structure under "Statement":



My account, called as AccountID B, should contain another trust policy, with the following structure under "Statement":
{
"Effect" : "Allow",
"Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
"Principal": {
"AWS" : "A"


}
Is that right?
