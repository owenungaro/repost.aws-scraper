I am attempting to use a CMK from "Account A" to encrypt SNS topics in "Account B". Then, using Cloudwatch Alarms in Account B, I am trying to send messages using SNS, also in Account B.


The error occurring in Account B, is "CloudWatch Alarms does not have authorization to access the SNS topic encryption key."


Let it be known, that when I disable the encryption on the SNS topic, the alarm works perfectly fine.
I have also attempted to follow the suggestions listed in 
this
 post, but none of them fixed my problem.


This is an example of the policy I am attempting to use:


In this case, let 111222333 = Account A and 444555666 = Account B






As you can see, I played around with a lot of the permissions, attempting to find an answer to the error, but I was unable to get the policy to work.


I also tried appending the exact name of the SNS topic in Account B, in case it needed to be more specific and not so vague/open, but it had no effect either.


I believe the other SNS topics I have in Account B work perfectly fine being encrypted with a key from Account A, but it is specifically Cloudwatch Alarms that is not working. Is it possible to use a key from another account to encrypt SNS and use Cloudwatch alarms, or is it impossible currently?


Thank you for your help.
