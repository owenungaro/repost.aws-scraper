Hi I am trying to create a policy that restrict uploading objects without encryption, also want to create an exemption for certain buckets tagged with reserved tag 
exempted
 this doesn't seem to work, i think the reason probably is that tags at the bucket level are not checked when object resource is being added.


Is there an alternative to create SCP exemptions at bucket level?
