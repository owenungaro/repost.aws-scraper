Hi all,
I build a system with nrf sdk and nRF9151 chip. I created a thing in aws iot core, create certs and attach policy, for my first test I use a very permissive policy






So to be cut I've followed 
this tutorial from nordic
, everything work, I'm able to connect, subscride, publish etc.


But for now I'd like to create no permissive policy, but despite all my attempts I cannot get my system to work.
What I want to do:




be able to subscribe to topics like /TOP/359404230604599/*


be able to receive to topics like /TOP/359404230604599/*


be able to connect with clientID 359404230604599 (same as my thing name)




here is what I've tried


{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iot:Connect",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iot:Publish",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:eu-west-3:removed:topic/TOP/359404230604599/"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iot:Subscribe",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:eu-west-3:removed:topicfilter/TOP/359404230604599/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "iot:Receive",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:eu-west-3:removed:topic/TOP/359404230604599/*"
    }
  ]
}



It's doesn't work, it's look like as soon as I add something behind topic/ or topicfilter other than 
*
I'm blocked...


What I miss ?


Thanks
