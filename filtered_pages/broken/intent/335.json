I want my manager to be able to connect and upload to our S3 bucket via an FTP client. (but  can't DELETE anything) So, I created a manager user group and policy, then assigned it. However, I get an error when I try to connect.


How can I write the S3 policy so the user can only connect and write but not delete any files?
