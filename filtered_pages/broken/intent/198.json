Hi all,


We are using 
AWS Control Tower
 to manage 
AWS Accounts
 in our 
Landing Zone
,
Unfortunately one of our principal regions (
eu-south-1
) isn't governed by 
Control Tower
, so in this case we need to setup/create resoures manually or using Terraform.


What we are trying to achieve is to setup a 
Terraform Pipeline
 which will enable ** AWS Config** and Create some 
Config Rules
 we are using usually in the regions 
Not-Governed
 by 
Control Tower
.


But the main issue right now is the following statement of an 
SCP
 created by 
Control Tower
 to prevent any modifications to 
AWS Config
 within the AWS Organization :


    



We tried to disable the 
Deny Regions
 feature in out Landing Zone but no success, the SCP is still there !!


Does anyone have idea how to overcome this issue  ?
any help would be greatly appreciated


Thanks


Peter
