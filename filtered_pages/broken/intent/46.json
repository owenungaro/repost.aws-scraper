Hi all,
I applied the aoss:DashboardsAccessAll policy to my ARN, but it doesn't seem like it's taking. The policy is written like this:





I've attached the policy to my IAM user, but when I go to the OpenSearch dashboard, I get a 401. The network access policy on the collection is set to Public.


An interesting note is that, in IAM, the "Permissions assigned to this policy" don't show the DashboardAcessAll action. I've attached an image. 


Thanks in advance
