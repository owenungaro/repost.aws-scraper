Hi there,
I am trying to subscribe an Amazon SQS queue located in the 
eu-west-1
 (Ireland) region to the Amazon Marketing Stream (AMS) 
sp-traffic
 dataset using the Subscription API (
POST https://advertising-api-eu.amazon.com/streams/subscriptions
).


However, I consistently receive a 
400 Bad Request
 error with the message:

{"message":"Unable to validate destination: arn:aws:sqs:eu-west-1:<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>:ams-eu-sp-traffic-queue"}

(Also tested with a new queue 
...:ams-eu-sp-traffic-queue2
 with the same result).


Details & Steps Taken:




Goal:
 Receive 
sp-traffic
 events in an SQS queue in 
eu-west-1
.


API Call:
 Using Python 
requests
 library with LWA Bearer Token authentication.


Authentication:
 Authentication seems successful (no 401/403 errors). Headers include 
Authorization
, 
Amazon-Advertising-API-ClientId
, 
Amazon-Advertising-API-Scope
, 
Content-Type
 (vnd.MarketingStreamSubscriptions...), and 
Accept
 (vnd.MarketingStreamSubscriptions...).


Region:
 Confirmed SQS queue is Standard type and located in 
eu-west-1
. The API endpoint used is the EU one (
advertising-api-eu.amazon.com
).


SQS Policy:
 Attached the following policy to the SQS queue (Resource ARN confirmed correct):







Troubleshooting Tried:




Confirmed the 
Resource
 ARN in the policy matches the target SQS queue.


Confirmed the 
aws:SourceArn
 and 
aws:SourceAccount
 values match the details provided by Amazon for AMS in 
eu-west-1
.


Tried removing the entire 
Condition
 block from the policy – the error persisted.


Tried using a different 
aws:SourceArn
 found in a GitHub example (
arn:aws:sns:eu-west-1:668473351658:*
) – the error persisted.


Created a completely new SQS queue (
ams-eu-sp-traffic-queue2
) in 
eu-west-1
 with the correct policy – the error persisted.


Tried using AWS Signature v4 authentication (with IAM user keys) resulted in a 
401 Unauthorized
 error, which seems unrelated to the destination validation issue (likely IAM permission issue for the calling user).








Question:


Despite the SQS policy appearing correct and aligned with AWS documentation examples (allowing 
sns.amazonaws.com
 with 
SourceArn
 and 
SourceAccount
 conditions), AMS consistently fails to validate the SQS destination in 
eu-west-1
.


What could be causing this "Unable to validate destination" error? Are there any known issues, undocumented requirements (e.g., specific queue naming, tags, LWA scopes), potential SNS topic ARN changes, or further troubleshooting steps recommended for AMS SQS integration specifically in the 
eu-west-1
 region?


Thank you in advance!
