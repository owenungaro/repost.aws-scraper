I'm trying to create S3 event notification to SNS topic from an existing S3 bucket. I'm receiving "Unable to validate the following destination configurations".

Then I decided to focus on the S3 bucket part of the equation and created brand new bucket with exactly the same configuration, switched the SourceArn in the policy with the new bucket's arn and the event notification was successfully created.
