Hi Team.
I'm working on cross accounts, so i have a lambda function which delete the log group which doesn't have any retention period to it.
I'm assuming the role from other aws account using sts_connection = boto3.client('sts') in my lambda code.
I need a restriction rule to this role to just pick up a single lambda function i.e my lambda and not by the other lambda functions.
As of now i have policy:
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Sid": "VisualEditor0",
"Effect": "Allow",
"Action": [
"logs:DescribeLogGroups",
"logs:DeleteLogGroup"
],
"Resource": [
"arn:aws:logs:
:
:
"
]
}
]
}
Lambda Basic execution:
{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Effect": "Allow",
"Action": [
"logs:CreateLogGroup",
"logs:CreateLogStream",
"logs:PutLogEvents"
],
"Resource": "
"
}
]
}
TRUST RELATIONSHIP:

Kindly provide a solution to this as the plicy needs to be updated or conditions needs to be applied for the above policy, Thanks!
