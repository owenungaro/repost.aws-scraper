I'm experiencing an intermittent HTTP 429 error in AWS CodeBuild when the build is triggered through a Lambda function. The same build works perfectly fine when manually triggered through the AWS Console.


git fetch failed with exit status 128: POST git-upload-pack 
error: RPC failed; HTTP 429 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 429
fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly
