I'm trying to use a private image from ECR, i have configured the IAM Role with AdministratorAccess and TrustedPolicy as next:






In the Build configuration i used:


Configuration:
      Container:
        Registry: ECR
        Image: xxxx.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my_image



But i'm getting this error in the logs:
CLIENT_ERROR: Unable to pull customer's container image
