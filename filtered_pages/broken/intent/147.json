I'm facing an issue with deleting the configuration rule named "account-part-of-organizations-conformance-pack-zw3jpq3ja" in the us-east-1 region. I created from conformance pack and I deleted the entire pack from cloud formation stack(that I left one rule to select in the deletion process).Now that config rule selection is grey out as shown in the photo can neither delete nor edit it. I tried to delete it from aws cli and show me error that It's a service-linked rule, and I lack the necessary permissions to delete or edit it. This resulted in a charge of $0.31 for conformance pack evaluation and conformance pack item recorded. I'm concerned about potential future charges. I follow the steps the below link and give the permission but still having the issue.

This is my permission in json format that I add in IAM policy. I also set it in the permission boundary.






I also enable service policies in My aws  account. The json format is as follow.






{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}



Please help me it incur me charges everyday for this rule.
Thanks!!
