Hello guys, I need help on this matter. As the title says I am getting an error after I deployed my project. It is working fine in my local laptop. The language I used is python. So I made web page using python framework to grab some data from aws iot core and it is working as expected after this test I deploy it on Render. However, this error appears. I ask Render support but he says it is not on the server side. It is an exception thrown by awsIotSDK.




raise subscribeTimeoutException()
Aug 26 11:14:39 AM  AWSIoTPythonSDK.exception.AWSIoTExceptions.subscribeTimeoutException




So I search the web for troubleshooting, I found some post to changed the policy attached to the thing that is connected in aws iot core.
so my current policy looks like this below.






and nothing changed. it still throws an error.


As for my python code.


myAWSIoTMQTTClient = AWSIoTPyMQTT.AWSIoTMQTTClient(CLIENT_ID)
myAWSIoTMQTTClient.configureEndpoint(ENDPOINT, 8883)
myAWSIoTMQTTClient.configureCredentials(PATH_TO_ROOT, PATH_TO_KEY, PATH_TO_CERT)
myAWSIoTMQTTClient.configureMQTTOperationTimeout(30)
myAWSIoTMQTTClient.connect()



I hope someone can help me in this matter, because I've been searching the net and all the solution I have found is not working for me.


by the way below is the traceback:
