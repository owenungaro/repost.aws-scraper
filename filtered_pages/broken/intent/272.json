I have SSM document that accessing an S3 bucket using HTTPS. The bucket contains an installer . I can access the installer using below S3 policy, but it is open to public. Is there a way to restrict it to only in my Organization account?






I tried to add a condition but I got 403 Forbidden error.


			"Condition": {
			    "StringEquals": {
				    "aws:PrincipalOrgID": ["o-xxxxxxxx"] 
				}  
			}



Any suggestions?
