I have a role defined which is cross account assumed by a central technical user


Account A - techuser


Account B - role2assume


In the trust policy of the role2assume I limit the "sts:AssumeRole" to the user from Account A in conjunction with an external ID. Now I want to further limit the assumption to a specific IP CIDR within our corporate network (only access via VPN).
Following Policy returns with the error "No private IP CIDR allowed", where as 
https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/security/establishing-a-data-perimeter-on-aws/
 states that SourceIP can contain a corporate Network range.
