I get error "Failed to get the secret value" when pressing 'Retrieve Secret Value'




I am not an IAM user with a role, but logged in as an IAM-identity-center user.


My group has a permission-set containing the AWS-managed policy 
SecretsManagerReadWrite
.


The resource policy of the secret is set to deny all requests not coming from a specified VPCE (e.g. 
vpce-myvpce
) as follows:






How should I modify this policy in order to allow myself access to my secrets via the AWS Console, i.e. view and edit the key/value pairs?
