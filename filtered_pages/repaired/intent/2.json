I want to limit S3 operation of a certain S3 bucket only through the VPC endpoints, so I changed the S3 bucket policy to the way like






While after submitting this policy, I found myself not able to manage the S3 bucket attribute via AWS Management Console.  Every time I click on the bucket, the console just displays errors of "Insufficient permissions to ..." , even if I have enough IAM previlege to perform that operation.  Well, it makes perfect sense, but what if I still want to manage the bucket via AWS Management Console, how should the bucket policy to be set?
