In most regions the following KMS key policy






allows the account to use IAM policies to allow access to the KMS key, in addition to the key policy
.


However, 
in the Beijing and Ningxia Regions, there is no concept of the "root user" or "account user" credentials
. Creating KMS key with such policy (replacing 
arn:aws:
 with 
arn:aws-cn:
) fails. Is it possible to enable IAM policies for KMS keys in Chinese regions? If so, how?
