Morning, I am looking to give a user access to the metrics tab of an S3 bucket.  He has the following policy;






Now he can get to the S3 bucket with the URL in the console, but when the metrics tab is clicked, it does nothing.  The user wants to get the size and number of directories inside each of the top level folders.  I can probably do a custom metric, but just curious on why the metrics tab doesn't work and am I on the right track for those values.
