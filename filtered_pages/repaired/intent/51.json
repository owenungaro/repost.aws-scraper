Hi, I am trying out Amazon Q and using the Q retriever. I have successfully added a S3 bucket as the data source. As I try to sync the files in the S3, I received error:
"Access denied when calling Amazon Q business BatchPutDocument API. Please check your data source IAM role."


The IAM role for data source it is using has the following permissions policies. What else can be missing? Please advise.
