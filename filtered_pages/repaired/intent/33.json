The following is an example of a trust relationship of one IAM policy.





I'm getting the error 'Cannot exceed quota for ACLSizePerRole: 2048'. According to the document, we request the quota to increase to 4096. Still, It won't be sufficient. I need to add more roles to the above trust policy. Can anyone suggest a resolution?


There is a pattern in the name of roles. Is there any possibility of using regular expressions or Wildcards?
