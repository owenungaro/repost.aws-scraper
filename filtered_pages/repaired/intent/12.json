I want to create a resource policy for API Gateway that block all GET calls to 
myapi1
 expect calls to 
myapi1/status
 and 
myapi1/v1/*
 sub-paths.


Based on the documentation (
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-resource-policies-examples.html#apigateway-resource-policies-source-vpc-example
) I have created the following resource policy but it is not working:






I have first one Allow everything and them one Deny all "except" 
myapi1/status
 and 
myap1/v1/*
sub-paths (as doc suggest for the VPC example that is pretty similar).
But it blocks everything and a I get one 
401
 when I call 
myapi1/status
 path for example.
In the condition I have tried 
StringNotLike
 , 
StringNotEquals
 and 
ArnNotLike
 but has no effect and all the:


myapi1/status
myapi1/v1/*



are still blocked.


How to achieve this in a resource policy?
