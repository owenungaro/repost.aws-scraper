I have my application deployed on AWS AppRunner, which will call SNS to send an email.


mysns = boto3.client(
    "sns", 
)
response = mysns.publish(
    TopicArn = self.TOPIC_ARN,
    Message=message,
    Subject=subject,
)



I have set up an IAM role and gave it the policies 
AmazonSNSFullAccess
 and 
AWSAppRunnerServicePolicyForECRAccess


Trust relationship is as follows:






However, it still keeps giving an error 
botocore.exceptions.NoCredentialsError: Unable to locate credentials
.
