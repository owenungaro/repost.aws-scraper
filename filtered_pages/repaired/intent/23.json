Hi,


I have an EC2 instance running to which currently no IAM Instance Profile role is attached to it. I got one instance role created to which I'm trying to attach it to my existing EC2 instance. I can list and select that role in the dropdown option however when I submit the button for '
Update IAM role
' then I get this error as shown in the screenshot:-


Failed to attach instance profile
