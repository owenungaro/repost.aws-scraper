I have a bucket which restricts access to it only through access policy. I see that it is not working as expected. Here is the bucket policy -






The access point has the following policy -


{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam:: xxxxxxxxxxxx:user/admin"
            },
            "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:us-east-1: xxxxxxxxxxxx:accesspoint/admin-only-accesspoint"
        }
    ]
}



My intent is to restrict the bucket only to the admin user.  When I list the objects in the bucket 'admin-only-accesspoint', it is working fine.

aws s3api list-objects --bucket arn:aws:s3:us-east-1: xxxxxxxxxxxx:accesspoint/admin-only-accesspoint --profile admin 

But I am also able to do list objects with another user 'staff'.

aws s3api list-objects --bucket arn:aws:s3:us-east-1: xxxxxxxxxxxx:accesspoint/admin-only-accesspoint --profile staff 


Just wondering why the access is not restricted to admin user.
