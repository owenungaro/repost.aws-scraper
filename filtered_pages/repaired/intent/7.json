I have a S3 bucket with the following permission added to the bucket permission:






Together with an VPC endpoint to S3, I successfully restricted access to my bucket objects only to my AWS resources in the specified VPC.


I then would like to create a AWS backup plan to perform AWS backup on the S3 bucket. For testing, I tried to create an on-demand backup with a user role for AWS backup with AmazonS3FullAccess and AWSBackupServiceRolePolicyForS3Backup managed policies, but I am still with insufficient permission to perform the backup. I was able to perform the backup if I remove the above S3 bucket permission.


My question is: Is it possible to perform AWS backup on my S3 bucket if I want to keep the above S3 bucket permission to restrict access to my VPC? If it is possible, how should I specify the permissions of user role used for running the AWS backup?
