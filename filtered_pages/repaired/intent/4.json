I'm trying to start a port forwarding session to our RDS through a bastion host.  I have it working for an administrator, now i'm trying to implement least permissions.


aws ssm start-session --region ap-southeast-1 --target i-55555555555555555 --document-name AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost --parameters host="our-rds.yyyyyyyyyyy.ap-southeast-1.rds.amazonaws.com",portNumber="3306",localPortNumber="3306"





I get an error, but already have the StartSession in the policy.




An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the StartSession operation: User: arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyyy:user/testuser is not authorized to perform: ssm:StartSession on resource: arn:aws:ssm:ap-southeast-1::document/AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost because no identity-based policy allows the ssm:StartSession action




I am successful with a simple start-session command: aws ssm start-session --target i-55555555555555555




I have two RDS instances, and would like to limit it to just one RDS host, and don't know what policy to add




My policy:
