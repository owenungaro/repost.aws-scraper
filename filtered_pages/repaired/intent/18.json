Hi there,
I followed the 
guide
 to create a Custom Policy to allow only 
AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost
 action to a bastion host.


This is the Policy I created and getting 
AccessDeniedExcepton






However, if I set 
Resource
 to 
*
 for 
ssm:StartSession
 action I am able to start a session with 
StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost
. Can you please guide me about what I am missing? I literally followed the simple examples from the guide. Thanks
