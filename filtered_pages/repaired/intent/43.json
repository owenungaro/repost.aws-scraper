Hello,


I have a Lambda function that is called asynchronously. With this lambda function is associated a role with a trust relationship policy that allows only this lambda function to assume it, like this:






It's working well.


Now, to manage the lambda failures, I want to create an OnFailure destination. But I can't. The API calls PutFunctionEventInvokeConfig or UpdateFunctionEventInvokeConfig fail at the validation of the Trust Relationship policy, stating that I need to add the Lambda service as a Trusted Entities.


Does someone know why a destination configuration needs the role to be accessible by the entire Lambda service and if there are still ways to limit what can access this role please?
