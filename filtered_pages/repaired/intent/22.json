Dear Team - Can anyone help me on best way to implement SCP to block the S3 public read access. It should not impact the existing one and only deny when someone trying to create the new bucket and add Policy/ACL for public access. I tried below but still users are able to create new bucket and can apply s3 policy for public read access.
