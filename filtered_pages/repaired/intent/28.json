I am hosting a static website on s3 and using CloudFront (CDN) distribution domain name to access me website but have been receiving 'denied access' xml page instead. To save everyone time i have provided context and troubleshooting approaches i have already tried. Looking forward to everyone's solution and advice!


Context:




S3 settings
 :


Encryption
 - SSE-S3 (server-side encryption)


Static website hosting
 - disabled


Permission
 Block public access (ALL ON)


Bucket Policy (copied over from Cloudfront OAC policy)
 :








Cloudfront/Origin Settings




Origin Domain
: selected s3 bucket housing the website (example: cloud-website.s3.ap-southeast-2amazon.com)


OAC selected


HTTP redirect to HTTPS protocol policy selected




My troubleshooting so far:




Confirm i can access index.html url in s3 when block public access is OFF.


Turned off Block public access on s3 but still getting denied access via CDN domain.
