Hi all,


I have 2 accounts:




Mgmt (SSO enabled)


Development (RDS)




I have 
SSO
 configured with a group (team_leaders) and permission set (TeamLeaderAccess).


Are part of this group:




john


michael




I've configured a RDS DB (Postgre) with IAM Auth and created these users into the database.


Now I'm trying to configure the 
Permission Set
 with this policy:






In this case, John is able to get his SSO credentials and log-in into RDS 
as john AND michael
 (impersonation), because I have this "/*" in my policy.


On the other hand, if I replace that by:


{
    "Action": "rds-db:connect",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:rds-db:us-east-1:<account>:dbuser:db-KF.../john"
}



Michael won't be able to log in.


How to setup a policy per user?


Has anyone faced this scenario and found a solution for it?


Thanks,
