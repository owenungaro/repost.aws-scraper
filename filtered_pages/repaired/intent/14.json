I've a IAM user
It's part of group FullAdmins
This group has the policy 'AdministratorAccess'
This policy allows ALL actions on EVERY and EACH resources






I configured cli to use this iam user


But I cannot assume a role


aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::888......380:role/cli --role-session-name prove-template-ipv6



I got




An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the AssumeRole operation: User: arn:aws:iam::667.....831:user/myIamUserName is not authorized to perform: sts:AssumeRole on resource: arn:aws:iam::888...380:role/cli




Why?


My IAM user is exentially god ! can do everything it wants, but ... cannot assume role!??!
