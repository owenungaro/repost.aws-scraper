I am trying to figure where my issue is, but I have account A and account B.   I have a server in account B that needs access to an S3 bucket in account A via an IAM role and can't get it to work, but this is what I have.


**Account A:  **




S3 bucket setup


Role setup with a Policy to access that bucket.




Account A Role Trust relationship;






Account B Trust relationship;

Server Role setup.


{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}



So, from Account A, I stuck that role on a server and since the trust is allowed using the ec2.service, it works (so I know the policy is correct as well), however from Account B server, I get the list denied.  I think I am just missing something that says from the Account B role/trust that hey your allowed, but not sure that is the case.


Thanks for all reads/help.
