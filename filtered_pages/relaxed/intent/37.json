As mentioned in the AWS documentation, I created policy to allow delete IAM users' operation.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_delegate-permissions_examples.html


"Deleting the user. This task requires permissions to perform all of the following actions: DeleteSigningCertificate, DeleteLoginProfile, RemoveUserFromGroup, and DeleteUser"



But it doesn't allow to delete users.
