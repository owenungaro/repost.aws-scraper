Hi,
I have an AWS organization with multiple account (
root_account
, 
account_1
, 
account_2
, ... 
account_n
). What I'm trying to do is, starting from an user in 
root_account
, be able to assume role in any of the others organization accounts (
account_x
).
In every 
account_x
 I've created a role 
account_example_role
 with the following trust relationship:






while in 
root_account
 I have the role 
root_example_role
 with the following plicy:


{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sts:AssumeRole"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:iam::<account_1>:role/account_example_role",
                "arn:aws:iam::<account_2>:role/account_example_role",
                ...
                "arn:aws:iam::<account_x>:role/account_example_role"
            ]
        }
    ]
}



and this seems to work, but it's hard to maintain.


I was wondering if there is a way to specify an organization wide role arn inside the 
root_example_role
 policy, something like this:


"Resource": "arn:aws:organizations::<root_account_id>:organization/o-<org-ID>/role/account_example_role"



so that it's no longer needed to update the 
root_example_role
 policy for every new account in the organization.
