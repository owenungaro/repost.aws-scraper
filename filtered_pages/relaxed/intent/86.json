I have 2 AWS accounts, Account "A" contain AWS Redshift and Account "B" has external data that crawler from S3.


What I have done


Account A




Attached spectrum role to Redshift



Attached inline policy in 
role1
 to sync between both account










In Inline policy also add Trust relationships




{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "redshift.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}



Account B




Attached role to access S3 and Glue.



Attached custom role name 
role2




{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectVersion",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectLegalHold",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:DeleteObjectVersion"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::test*"
            ]
        }





In 
role2
 also add trust relationships




{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "glue.amazonaws.com",
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::yyyyyyyyyy:role/role1"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}



Result


After I ran script to create external database from data catalog. Then I can query data from that external database with root. 
But I need to query with another user.


####To grant database permission


I have run this script


grant select on EXTERNAL TABLE "schema"."database"."tableName" to read_user



I got this result


Grantee can only be an IAM Role or PUBLIC for grants on external resources
