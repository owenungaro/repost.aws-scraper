In my AWSMarketplace product listing I get always a "FAILD" status in case of:


                    "ErrorCode": "ASSET_ACCESS_EXCEPTION",
                    "ErrorMessage": "We don't have the necessary permissions to read the contents of the specified component ARN [arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-east-1::component//1]. Ensure that the IAM access role provided in the API input has the required read 
permissions."



The provided role inside the change-set has the inlinepolicy:






And with Trust relationships


{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}



What is wrong here with my role?
