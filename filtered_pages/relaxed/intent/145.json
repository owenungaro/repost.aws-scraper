Hi,
We are trying to create a elastic beanstalk environment through CDK. First step is to create Elastic Beanstalk Application and that fails with authorization error. We have the permissions associated with the user.
Anything else we should add? We also tried to add explicitly beanstalk access to this user, but still getting the same error?
