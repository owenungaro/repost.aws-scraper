Hello,


I have a JWT issued by an IDP with 
roles=["role1"]
, I would like to match an IAM role based on that JWT role, I tried:






It seems like the 
roles
 claim is not propogated, as it never matches with ForAnyValue and matches everything with ForAllValues. Does anyone have an experience of how to match based on on roles claim? I do not have issue with other string based claims.


Regards,
Alon
