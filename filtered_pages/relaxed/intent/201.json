400 Bad Request
 error response to all my requests to create MediaConvert jobs in us-west-2.

I have double checked and this 
is
 a valid ARN of a role which exists in the account and has the following Trust Relationship policy required for MediaConvert:






Could I be doing something wrong, or is this a fault with AWS?
