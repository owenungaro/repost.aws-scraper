Hi all,
We have service hosted on ECS Fargate & we have an OpenSearch Domain that has fine-grained access enabled[user].
On Service side we have enabled the OpenSearchServiceReadOnlyAccess since service is just doing get /search operations on the OpenSearch Domain



On OpenSearch Domain side we have below -



When a Service ECS task try to make search calls on OpenSearch Domain we get a bellow error -


User: arn:aws:sts::xxxxxxxxxxxx:assumed-role/service-TaskRole/54bbad32d1f24ee99e40f74f36f076b5 is not authorized to perform: es:ESHttpPost because no identity-based policy allows the es:ESHttpPost action



Can some one help . Do I need to add an Identity based policy like below -






Or is there anything else we want to do ?
