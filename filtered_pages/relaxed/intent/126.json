Dear AWS experts,


I am trying to build a monitoring dashboard that will monitor the status of AWS Health Dashboard, where we want to monitor the status of the Transcribe service in the Ohio region.


I am using the lambda function to monitor the AWS Health Dashboard. When I run the lambda function, I get the following response:


"errorMessage": "An error occurred (SubscriptionRequiredException) when calling the DescribeEvents operation: "



Lambda Function:


import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    health = boto3.client('health')
    response = health.describe_events()
    status = response['events'][0]['statusCode']
    
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')
    s3.put_object(Bucket='status_m', Key='health-dashboard-status.txt', Body=status)



The region is set to 
us-east-2 Ohio
.


Function log:


START RequestId: d359f1e0-a14f-49c9-ba53-5234917f6e2f Version: $LATEST
[WARNING]	2023-05-08T11:27:48.662Z	d359f1e0-a14f-49c9-ba53-5234917f6e2f	Client is configured with the deprecated endpoint: us-east-2
[ERROR] ClientError: An error occurred (SubscriptionRequiredException) when calling the DescribeEvents operation: 



Note: The role associated with the lambda function has a custom policy called 
AWSHealthReadOnlyAccess
 that looks like the below:






I am not sure what I am missing here. I appreciate your help in advance.


Kind Regards
