I've been searching the web and mostly amazon docs all day and couldn't find an answer to this issue.


I have (root user) several Buckets in AWS S3.


I've assigned a new bucket to a new IAM user and I don't want him to see all the buckets names under: 
https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets
 (He can access his bucket at: 
https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/HISBUCKETNAME
)


However, I also want the user to be able to rename file in his bucket. This is impossible if I remove ListAllMyBuckets from his IAM policy.


So in the working user IAM policy I have






Unfortunately now the users can see all the buckets in 
https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets
 (though he doesn't have access to them).


Once I remove "s3:ListAllMyBuckets", the user get access denied when trying to rename a file in his bucket.


Is there a way to allow the user to rename a file in his bucket without him having access to the list of all the bucket names (I.E. without ListAllMyBuckets)?


Thanks
