Following the tutorial for 
IoT Ingestion to Sitewise - Step 7
, the Sitewise action creates an unworkable policy if there are substitutions in the property alias (as described in the tutorial).  Regardless of whether you create a fresh role, or assign to an existing role, the policy is unworkable because it doesn't take account of the substitution in the policy alias.







Elsewhere in the docs where it describes 
how to construct rules
 and talks about a more liberal policy.  If the generated policy is left in place, no data will be ingested (set a MQTT topic or log for the error action in the rule and you'll see the failure messages relating to no matching policy.


If you modify the policy to have a more liberal policy, then the ingestion will work.
