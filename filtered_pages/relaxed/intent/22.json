Hi,


I am trying to configure a scheduled query using Redshift Query Editor V2. However, I am facing an issue where I am unable to view the schedule history as I am faced with the following permission issue.




You don't have permission to view the scheduled query history. To view, add sts:AssumeRole for IAM role arn:aws:iam::000001:role/XXXXXXX-runner to your IAM role and add your IAM user ARN to the role's trust policy.






Bit confused as to what this permission requirement means. Which IAM role should I update with the sts:AssumeRole permission?


I have attached the following policy to the IAM users via the IAM group





I followed this guide and updated the permissions as necessary -> 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/query-editor-v2-schedule-query.html


Trust policy of the role used in the scheduled query (XXXXXXX-runner)

,

]


			
}
,


			
"Action"
:
 
"sts:AssumeRole"


		
}


	
]


}


Any guidance on how to troubleshoot this issue is much appreciated.


Thank You
