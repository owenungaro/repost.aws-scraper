I have an EFS file system policy below[2]. Using the principal of 
AWS:*
 allows my Fargate task to mount the file system.  I'd like to tighten up the principal but can't figure out what works. Going off some documentation 
here
, I've tried[1] principals similar to the examples (with my account ID substituted) but the task fails to start with errors
like 
unsuccessful EFS utils command execution; code: 32
. I don't get if the error is coming from missing taskRole/taskExecutionRole policies, or rather something missing for the Fargate service/cluster/assumed role itself.


Do I need to add a Role Session principal (since Fargate is assuming my role at some point to launch the task) and if so how do I find out what that is?


Secondly, is there any better way to debug errors like these than just burn-and-learn? All I have in Cloudtrail is stuff like "Trying something, something failed, obscure error #"
