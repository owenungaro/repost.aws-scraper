I have changed a ECS service to scheduled task.


After the change the task no longer writes on CloudWatch.
The scheduled task has a specific role on eventbridge with:




AmazonEC2ContainerServiceEventsRole




And one inline policy





The task is executed (I see it on eventbridge metrics) but the logs not are writed.


Also I see and "Amazon CloudWatch IAM role" in the console that not is configured but i don't know how configure it, I can't see any documentation




How I can get cloudwatch permisions for an scheduled task?
