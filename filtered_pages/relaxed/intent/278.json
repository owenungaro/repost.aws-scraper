Bucket policy:





From AWS CLI, got the "Access Denied" error when trying the List Bucket command as the above $username:


C:>aws s3api list-buckets --profile $username


An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the ListBuckets operation: Access Denied


However, the same command above with the "Default" profile works fine:


C:>aws s3api list-buckets (works fine)


The AWS CLI installed is the latest version as of today, June 9 2023.
