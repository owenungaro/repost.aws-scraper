Hi AWS, I have created an SCP to explicitly deny use of AWS services other than 4 approved AWS regions, i.e. 
us-east-1
, 
us-east-2
, 
us-west-1
 and 
us-west-2
. Here is the SCP code:







Now we're planning to enable only AWS config in the non-approved/restricted regions and I have tweaked the original SCP like this:


{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowAllActionsInUSRegions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "aws:RequestedRegion": [
                        "us-east-1",
                        "us-east-2",
                        "us-west-1",
                        "us-west-2"
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "DenyAllActionsOutsideUSRegions",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringNotEquals": {
                    "aws:RequestedRegion": [
                        "us-east-1",
                        "us-east-2",
                        "us-west-1",
                        "us-west-2"
                    ]
                }
            }
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AWSAllConfigGlobally",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "config:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}



Do you think the modified SCP would fulfill the requirement to enable AWS config in all regions or is there something that needs to be identified and fixed. Please advise.
