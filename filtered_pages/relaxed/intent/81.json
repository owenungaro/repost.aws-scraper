Hello,


I have an NLB in which I want to enable an access log and for that, I have assigned a S3 bucket.
But I'm having this error 
"Access Denied for bucket: qa-nlb-lo. Please check S3bucket permission"
 despite making policy based on AWS official documentation

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-access-logs.html


The policy is below -







In place of an account-no I have added my aws account number, but still facing this issue. I will be grateful if someone can point out my mistake and help me resolve this issue.


Thanks
