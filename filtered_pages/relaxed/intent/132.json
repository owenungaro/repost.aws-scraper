We have setup Q Business Application with IAM Identity Center and authenticating through Cognito User Pool & Identity Pool. When we create temporary credentials using username, password and identity pool and try and access Q Business Chat Method in JS SDK of client-qbusiness, it shows error as


"An error was encountered in a non-retryable streaming request.
AWS Q Business Error: AccessDeniedException: User is not authorized for this service call."


We have mapped the role with permissions as Q Business Full Access & STS Cognito Policies along with trust policies as below, please help me what am missing to make it work. Thanks.
