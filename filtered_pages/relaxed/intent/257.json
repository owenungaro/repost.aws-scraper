I'm trying to add a timestream DB from account A to a quicksight in account B.


I created a role in account A for account B to assume, with a Custom trust policy






and a policy


{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "timestream:DescribeEndpoints",
        "timestream:SelectValues",
        "timestream:Select",
        "timestream:ListTables",
        "timestream:ListDatabases"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}



I also tried with
"timestream:*"


But I am unable to get to the data.


I searched in the quicksight configuration for an option to add but didn't find anything. Also added manually a custom policy in the quicksight role to assume the role in account A.


{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::<ID_ACCOUNT_A>:role/QuickSightCrossAccountAccessRole"
    }
  ]
}



Supposedly in Manage QuickSight > Security & permissions, should be an option to manage cross account options, but I find none.


Is this posible? I miss something?


Thanks.
