Hi, I have a secret in account 111111111111 and I'm trying to access it from account 222222222222.


To do this I followed this tutorial 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_examples_cross.html


I have this policy attached to a role called 
my-super-role


 



and this resource policy in the secret 
mysecret


{ 
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [ 
        { 
            "Effect" : "Allow", 
            "Principal" : { 
                "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::222222222:role/my-super-role" 
            }, 
            "Action" : "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue", 
            "Resource" : "*" 
        } 
    ] 
} 



and I get the error


 User: arn:aws:sts::222222222:assumed-role/my-super-role/i-xxxxxxxxxx is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: arn:aws:secretsmanager:sa-east-1:111111111:secret:mysecret because no resource-based policy allows the secretsmanager:GetSecretValue action 



I've also specified the ARN of the secret in the resource policy of itself and that didn't change anything
