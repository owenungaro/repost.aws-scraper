Is it possible to have a single IAM role for OpenID Connect, which allows multiple repos, or even the entire GitHub org to assume it, yet have different permissions by repo?


For example, I have a trust policy like this:





And I'd like to grant the repo 
org/foo
 one set of permissions and 
org/bar
 another.


The idea is to have a single "well-known" role, which we can also hard code, so that we wouldn't have to create separate roles for each repo.
