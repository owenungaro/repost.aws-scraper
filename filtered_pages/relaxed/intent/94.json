Hello,
I'm using Prisma Cloud App service intergratino feature to send messages to an SQS I created in AWS. However, the app is not able to call the SQS que. I would like to confirm everything is right on AWS Side.


I have created a rule with the necessary permissions and actions to perform on the SQS que for the account to assume using the root principal. I'm wondering if there's some sort of access I must explicitly also allow on the SQS que?


Note this is cross account access. The third party app is in another account.The permissions on the SQS is default. The permissions for the assume role is listed below.





And the trust policy


{     "Version": "2012-10-17",     "Statement": [         {             "Effect": "Allow",             "Principal": {                 "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<account_id>:root"             },             "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",             "Condition": {                 "StringEquals": {                     "sts:ExternalId": "<external_id>"                 }             }         }     ] }


Is there anything I'm missing?
