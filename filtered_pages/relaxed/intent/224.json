Hi,


We're currently building an MSK cluster. We use 2 types of authentication for 2 different clients.


The IAM authentication works fine.


But for the SASL/SCRAM authentication that it's not the case, we created a secret for username/password connection and linked it to the MSK cluster.


Using our client or with a UI client for windows it's the same issue we have a connection but with limited functionalities (like creating a topic or reading one).


Please take a look at the error the UI clients returns :




Could not complete DescribeConfigs action: you can try to continue with limited functionality. ClusterAuthorizationException: Cluster authorization failed.
Make sure that your user has all access rights (DescribeConsumerGroups, DescribeCluster, DescribeConfigs) for full functionality.




Also take a look at our AWS secret policy JSON file :






Do we need to modify the ACLs policies directly on the Kafka instance ? How?


Thanks
