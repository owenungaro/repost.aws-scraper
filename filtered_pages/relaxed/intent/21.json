HI folks,


I feel like this should be super simple, but I think i have everything enabled as it should be.


I have a user, to whom I've given a policy like:






However, he cannot see the bucket in the bucket list view. No buckets are listed. I would think, since I've given the user the action 
s3*
 for that bucket, they should be able to see that bucket listed. Am I wrong?


Cheers.
