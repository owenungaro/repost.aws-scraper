Hi all,


In our 
AWS Organization
 We've a 
LogArchive Centralized Account
 used by our 
Security Team
 where We usually send all CloudWatch logs from all of our Application Accounts "The Accounts where we deploy our Applications Workloads".


We are looking forward to doing the same with 
CloudFront Real-Time logs
 , We need to send all of them to this 
Centralized Log Account
.


I tried quickly using the CLI to setup the 
Real-Time Logs
 Configuration for one of our 
CloudFront Distributions
 pointing to a 
Kinesis Data Stream 
and a 
IAM Role
 in the
 LogArchive Account
 :




CLI Command :




aws cloudfront create-realtime-log-config --cli-input-json "file://rtl-config.json" 





JSON Input :




{
    "EndPoints": [
        {
            "StreamType": "Kinesis",
            "KinesisStreamConfig": {
                "RoleARN": "arn:aws:iam::LogAccountID:role/CloudFrontRealtimeLogConfigRole",
                "StreamARN": "arn:aws:kinesis:eu-west-3:LogAccountID:stream/demoDataStream"
            }
        }
    ],
    "Fields": [
        "c-country"
    ],
    "Name": "demorealtime",
    "SamplingRate": 1
}





IAM Role Trust RelationShip in the LogArchive Account :










Test Results :




An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the CreateRealtimeLogConfig operation: Cross-account pass role is not allowed. 



So, I was wondering if there is a direct way to send all 
CloudFront Real-Time Logs 
to a Cross-Account
 Kinesis Data Stream/Firehose
 ?


Thanks
