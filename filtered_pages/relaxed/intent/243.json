Hello, I'm trying to import a Windows image to EC2 using the 
ImportImage
 feature, but I keep encountering the following error:


InvalidParameter: The service role admin provided does not exist or does not have sufficient permissions.



Context:


I’ve created the required IAM role for VM Import/Export, but the error persists despite following the standard documentation. Here are the details:






IAM Role Policy for 
vmimport
 Role
 (as per AWS documentation):









Trust Relationship
 for 
vmimport
:


{


  
"Version"
:
 
"2012-10-17"
,


  
"Statement"
:
 
[


    
{


      
"Effect"
:
 
"Allow"
,


      
"Principal"
:
 
{


        
"Service"
:
 
"ec2.amazonaws.com"


      
}
,


      
"Action"
:
 
"sts:AssumeRole"


    
}


  
]


}






Policies attached to the user account:




AdministratorAccess


AmazonEC2FullAccess


AmazonS3FullAccess


AWSImportExportFullAccess


VMImportExportRoleForAWSConnector








Steps I’ve Taken:




I ensured that the 
vmimport
 role is correctly created and has the necessary policies (
vmimport
, S3 permissions, EC2 permissions).


Double-checked that the trust relationship allows EC2 to assume the role.


Verified the bucket permissions and ensured the region aligns with EC2 and S3.




Despite all this, the error persists. It seems related to role or permission configuration, but I can't pinpoint the issue.


Questions:




Is there anything specific I’m missing or doing wrong in configuring the 
vmimport
 role or the permissions?


Are there any additional steps I need to take to resolve this error?




Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
