Hi!
I'm currently running a 
secondary process on gamelift instances
 to help with server log gathering. This process needs some AWS permissions, which it acquires by doing an 
assumeRole on the fleet's InstanceRole.

This instanceRole is setup with the following trust policy :






I haven't been monitoring that logging process very closely, and recently discovered that it wasn't able to assume this role anymore.
I've been trying to specify the gamelift region, to no avail. The only way I was able to re-assume the role from the instance was to get the instance's role through get-caller-identity (after ssm-ing on the instance), and adding this auto-generated role to the trust policy by hand.


Here's the error that happens when attempting to assume-role from the gamelift fleet:


sh-4.2$ aws sts assume-role --role-arn=arn:aws:iam::<accountId1>:role/the-role-i-want-to-assume --role-session-name=testassumesession
An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the AssumeRole operation: User: arn:aws:sts::<accountId2>:assumed-role/DevAppStack-58eee978-59ae-42a0-9a8-AppInstanceRole-EDM3O84AF9S0/i-09dbb0c0bde30b348 is not authorized to perform: sts:AssumeRole on resource: arn:aws:iam::<accountId1>:role/the-role-i-want-to-assume



I'm kind of in the dark about what the default "assumed-role" we see here really is: I presume it's a default AWS account that represents gamelift, but I'm not too sure about it ?


Any ideas why the assumeRole doesn't work anymore, or ideas of things to try out ?
Thanks !
