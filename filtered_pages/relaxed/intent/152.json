To setup new billing, I tried to follow the steps described at 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_billing.html#tutorial-billing-prereqs
:






Sign in to the AWS Management Console with your root user credentials (specifically, the email address and password that you used to create your AWS account).


On the navigation bar, choose your account name, and then choose Account.

Select the Activate IAM Access check box to activate access to the Billing and Cost Management console pages.


Choose Update.
