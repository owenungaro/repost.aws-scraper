Hi,


I would like to have a simple homepage check that checks Grafana that we use for alerting.
Grafana is only accessible from inside the VPC or specif external ip adresses.
IAM Policy used by the Role:






But in the logs it says it can't find the bucket.


Failed to get the S3 bucket name.: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" } 



Can't find anything on google about this, tried to have vpc endpoint to cloudwatch but according to the documentation it should not be needed.
The bucket is in the same region as the cloudwatch canarie.
