I have created a crawler to insert data from redshift tables into the glue data catalog. I have created the glue connection and an IAM role with the following policies:


AmazonRedshiftFullAccess
AmazonS3FullAccess
AWSGlueServiceRole
CloudwatchLogsFullAccess


and an inline policy with the following permissions:



but when I try to run the crawler I obtain the error message:
Crawler cannot be started. Verify the permissions in the policies attached to the IAM role defined in the crawler.
