Hey folks,


I have a customer-managed KMS key that was created to encrypt a specific CloudWatch 
log group
. In the key policy, I have something like:






However, anyone in the AWS account 
can see the decrypted logs
. Is it possible to only allow users that have access to this KMS key via 
kms:Decrypt*
 to decrypt logs, like we do in S3, or is not possible to do this on CloudWatch log groups?
