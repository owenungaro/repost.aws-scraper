Hi,
I've been learning terraform, and created a S3 bucket hosting a nuxt app and a cloudfront distribution pointing to said bucket.
This setup is working perfectly when accessing the bucket via the Distrib url, however I want to use a custom subdomain from a domain name I own (I'm using OVH for the domain).
I've set up the DNS record like so:
[xxxx.yyyy.fr] CNAME [Distrib URL].
I also created an ACM certificate pointing to said subdomain, had it validated using DNS entries, and added it to the distrib. I have the custom subdomain set up in the cloudfront Alternate Domain Names.


To note: I have set up both the certificate and alternate domain name as "xxxx.yyyy.fr" and not "*.xxxx.yyyy.fr", I don't know if that could be the issue.


Whenever I visit the subdomain, I'm getting a "This site can't be reached", "DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN".
I've also checked the CNAME record propagation, and it seems to be configured properly.


I've set up the bucket Policy like so:






Here are the S3 CORS policy


[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "POST",
            "GET",
            "HEAD",
            "DELETE",
            "PUT"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "*"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": [],
        "MaxAgeSeconds": 0
    }
]



Any ideas as to why I can use the distrib's url but not my custom subdomain ?
Thanks.
