I want to use one route in an rest api gateway to be available to any IAM access within a part of my organization.


From my understanding an the documentations I've read it should work, but I'm unable to get it running.
With the 
aws:ResourceOrgPaths
[1] I should be able to write the condition and it's available within the resource policy [2].


With this policy I get "... is not authorized to perform: execute-api:Invoke on ..."






Without the condition it just works fine obviously.


With this condition it works fine as well:


      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "aws:ResourceOrgID": "o-orgid"
        }
      }



Something I'm missing with the ResourceOrgPaths here. Can somebody help with some light in the dark? Thanks!
