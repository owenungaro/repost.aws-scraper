OAUTH authorization via Cognito works and we can use it if the client uses Amazon and this type of authorization.
However, I could not configure access (get/put) to the S3 storage. When creating an Amazon API Gateway, I get the error "AWS ARN for integration contains invalid action". I tried different IAM Role settings for API Gateway, but I got the same error. I tried the following settings


`


{
"Version": "2012-10-17",
"Statement": [
{
"Effect": "Allow",
"Action": [
"s3:
"
],
"Resource": "
"
}
]
}`


IAM Policy Simulator shows that all S3 permissions are allowed.
