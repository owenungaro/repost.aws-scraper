Admittedly, I'm an amateur when it comes to AWS S3 policy language. A few years ago, I set up a bucket to host videos for an online LMS that I run. I followed a guide that helped me set up the policy for the bucket to make sure no one could watch the video except from an embed run from my LMS's domain.


I'm now in the process of transferring to a new LMS and need to be able to use both domains. Being a developer outside of the AWS eco-sphere, I used simple logic about JSON to add a new domain to my policy. It sort of worked. Instead of getting a complete access denied page upon embedding a video link, I got the video player up and running. But I'm still getting a 403 forbidden error and the video won't play. My policy as it stands is as follows:






The old domain (here labeled my first domain) is still working fine. Nevermind that I've changed the aws:Referer from a simple name value pair to an array. but the second domain still doesn't seem to be working.


Any ideas would be very much appreciated.
