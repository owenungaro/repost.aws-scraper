Hello  I'm kinda new in AWS I read a lot and I can't figure out what's going on.
when I try to use the lexv2


{


    
"message"
:
 
"Credential should be scoped to correct service: 'lex'. "


}


I did the following:




Create a CLI aws account (
test
 user)


I added the permissions: 
AmazonLexReadOnly
 and 
AmazonLexRunBotsOnly
 I even added another that I read in another website ( I Created a new policy) with this json:









I created an access api key/secret key


Added to postman as AWS identification and hitting this url

https://runtime-v2-lex.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/bots/KVI5WI1AAA/botAliases/UZA1JMDAAA/botLocales/en_US/sessions/random/text
 (the last letters I replaced with 
AAA
 just to hide the complete url and check if is the name or the ID)




I got the botId from lex website, the alias I think is the correct (same from lex but I'm not sure if is the name or this ID), the (access key 1 is the one I'm using, and says 
Access key last usedNever




I can't figure out what's wrong, I tried to read a lot of tutorials but I have no luck. How I can setup this correctly?
