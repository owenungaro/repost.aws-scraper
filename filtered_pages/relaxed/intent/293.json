Hi all


I can see account principals as follows. The following is a part of KMS key policy. What does that mean?


Any IAM resources including users and roles in that account? Or any resources in that account?


    



I've looked at the documentation - 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html
, but it does not say clearly.


Thanks.
