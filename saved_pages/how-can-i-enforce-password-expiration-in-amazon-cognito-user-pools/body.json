  "body": "I'm using Amazon Cognito User Pools for authentication and managing users. I want to enforce a password expiration policy\u2014e.g., require users to reset their password every 90 days\u2014but I don't see a built-in option in the Cognito console or documentation to set password expiration.\nIs there a recommended way to implement password expiration in Cognito? Can it be achieved natively, or do I need to build a custom solution using Lambda triggers or another service?\nAny guidance or best practices would be appreciated.\n\nAmazon Cognito does not have a built-in password expiration policy, btw you can:\nTrack Password Updates\no\tAdd a custom attribute like passwordUpdatedAt to store the last password change date.\no\tUpdate this attribute whenever a user resets their password.\nEnforce Expiration via Lambda Trigger\no\tUse a Pre-Authentication Lambda Trigger to check if the password is older than 90 days.\no\tIf expired, deny authentication and prompt the user to reset their password.\nAutomate Expiration Checks\no\tSchedule a CloudWatch Event to run a Lambda function that queries users with expired passwords.\no\tUse AdminResetUserPassword to force a reset for affected users.\nEnhance Security with Temporary Passwords\no\tCognito allows setting temporary passwords that expire after a set number of days.\no\tThis can be useful for enforcing password resets during onboarding.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/managing-users-passwords.html"
