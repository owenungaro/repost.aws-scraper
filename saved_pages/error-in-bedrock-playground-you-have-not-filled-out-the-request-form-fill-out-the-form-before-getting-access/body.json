  "body": "While I tried to access the bedrock playground, I'm getting this error \"You have not filled out the request form. Fill out the form before getting access.\" and unable to execute the prompts. Can someone please tell me why I'm getting this error.\n\nThis error occurs because you need to explicitly request access to specific foundation models before you can use them in Amazon Bedrock. Even if your AWS account is active, you need to go through a model access approval process.\nTo resolve this issue:\nNavigate to the Amazon Bedrock console\nGo to the \"Model access\" section\nSelect the specific models you want to use\nSubmit a request for access to these models\nWait for approval before you can use them in the playground\nIf you've already submitted the request form but still see this error, there could be several reasons:\nYour request might still be pending approval\nThere might be an issue with your AWS account permissions\nIf you're using an AWS Organizations account, there might be Service Control Policies (SCPs) restricting access\nIf you continue to experience issues after requesting model access, you can:\nCheck your IAM permissions to ensure you have the necessary rights\nTry operating from the root user account to rule out permission issues\nIf problems persist, consider opening a case with AWS Support under \"Account and billing\" for further assistance\nSources\nUnable to request any model access in AWS bedrock service | AWS re:Post\nI'm getting an \"Operation not allowed\" error when requesting access to Bedrock's models from an account with IAM administrator policy and verified payment method. | AWS re:Post\n\"Invalid Model Identifier Error in Amazon Bedrock and Unable to Request Specific Models\" | AWS re:Post\n\nI also see this error and am operating from the root user to rule out permission issues.  I have enabled the Amazon FMs in both London and us-east-1 (I see Access Granted) and I see the error when attempting to use the Playgrounds.  I am not using AWS Organizations SCP.  This is a new account."
