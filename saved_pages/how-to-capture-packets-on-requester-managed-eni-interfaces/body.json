  "body": "I need to capture packets (.pcap file) on requester-managed ENI interfaces. These ENIs are configured on EC2 instances that belong to an ECS cluster and are set up in awsvpc network mode. The traffic mirroring approach does not work in this case, as requester-managed network interfaces are not supported for traffic mirroring.\nPlease advice.\n\nYou're right \u2014 >traffic mirroring does not support requester-managed ENIs, including those used in ECS with awsvpc mode. Unfortunately, this limitation rules out using VPC traffic mirroring on these interfaces directly.\nHere's what you can do:\nCapture traffic inside the ECS container itself\nIf your ECS tasks are running in awsvpc mode, each task gets its own ENI. While you can\u2019t attach a traffic mirror to this ENI, you can still run packet capture tools inside the container or ECS task.\nAdd tcpdump or wireshark to your container image.\nRun a command like:\ntcpdump -i eth0 -w /tmp/capture.pcap\nYou can then copy the .pcap out of the container or ship it to S3 for analysis.\nNote: If you're using Fargate, this won\u2019t work \u2014 you\u2019ll need EC2-backed ECS.\nUse a sidecar container for packet capture\nFor ECS EC2 launch type, you can run a privileged sidecar container in the same task definition with networkMode: awsvpc. Use this container to capture traffic via shared ENI.\nEnable CAP_NET_RAW, CAP_NET_ADMIN in container task role.\nMount a shared volume to write .pcap files.\nRun tcpdump in the sidecar.\nIf you control the EC2 host (ECS-optimized AMI)\nYou can SSH into the EC2 instance and identify the ENI attached to the container using:\nip addr\nThen run:\nsudo tcpdump -i\n<eni-device-name>\n-w /tmp/container-capture.pcap\nThis is only viable if your security policies allow host access."
