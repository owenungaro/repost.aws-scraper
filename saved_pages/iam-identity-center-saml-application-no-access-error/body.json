  "body": "I want to sign in to a keycloak instance using aws iam identity center.\nmy users are provisioned by entra, and they work for sigining in to the aws console.\ni've set up a saml application and assigned myself as a user, set up keycloak accordingly.\nwhen i initiate the login flow from keycloak, i get forwarded to aws sso, and if signed out there to entra and back again, and there the flow stops  with a no access error. we never get back to keycloak.\nif i then press the show all apps button, the keycloak saml app is there.\ni've tried everything i can think of, scoured the internet and the ai's. i'm all out of ideas.\nwhat can i do to make that no access error go away, how can i discover whats actually going wrong.\n\nBased on your description, you're experiencing a \"No access\" error when trying to use IAM Identity Center with Keycloak as a SAML application, even though your users can successfully sign in to the AWS console.\nHere are some troubleshooting steps you can take:\nDebug the SAML assertions: IAM Identity Center provides a way to examine the SAML assertions being sent. When you're signed into the AWS access portal:\nHold down the Shift key\nClick on the Keycloak application tile\nRelease the Shift key\nThis will show you the \"You are now in administrator mode\" page with the SAML assertion details\nYou can choose \"Copy XML\" to save this information for analysis\nCheck for SAML attribute issues: The error might be related to missing or incorrect attributes in the SAML response. Common issues include:\nMissing required attributes in the SAML configuration\nIncorrect attribute mappings between IAM Identity Center and Keycloak\nEnsure the SAML response includes all necessary attributes with correct formatting\nVerify permission assignments: Make sure that:\nYour user is correctly assigned to the SAML application in IAM Identity Center\nThe permission sets assigned to your user for this application are appropriate\nThere are no conflicting policies or restrictions\nCheck session management: Since you mentioned using Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) as your identity source, be aware that IAM Identity Center does not support Single Logout (SLO) with external identity providers. This could potentially cause session-related issues.\nVerify username requirements: In some cases, very short usernames (like one character) can cause issues with IAM Identity Center. Ensure your username meets any length requirements.\nIf you continue to experience issues, you might need to contact AWS Support for further assistance, as there could be an underlying configuration problem that's not immediately apparent.\nSources\nNo access error during access to Management Console from the Access Portal for an IAM Identity Center's user with AdministratorAccess &/| PowerUserAccess permission sets | AWS re:Post\nSingle Logout (SLO) support for IAM Identity Center with Entra ID SSO | AWS re:Post\nTroubleshoot SAML federation with IAM - AWS Identity and Access Management\nTroubleshooting IAM Identity Center issues - AWS IAM Identity Center"
