  "body": "In Unified Studio, AutoML can only be run using data stored in S3. In contrast, is it possible to connect to other databases (e.g., PostgreSQL) and run AutoML in Canvas?\nAdditionally, since I\u2019m unable to open the Unified Studio domain in Canvas, does that mean I need to create a separate domain specifically for Canvas in order to use it?\n\nRegarding your questions about SageMaker Autopilot in Unified Studio and Canvas:\nBased on the available information, there's no explicit mention that Canvas allows direct connections to databases like PostgreSQL for running AutoML. The sources indicate that as of November 30, 2023, Autopilot's UI has been integrated into Amazon SageMaker Canvas, which provides no-code capabilities for tasks including data preparation and feature engineering. However, the sources don't specifically address connecting to external databases like PostgreSQL within Canvas for AutoML workflows.\nFor your second question about accessing Canvas, you shouldn't need to create a separate domain specifically for Canvas. SageMaker Canvas is now part of the updated Amazon SageMaker Studio experience. If you're unable to access Canvas from your Unified Studio domain, you might need to update permissions for your user profile or IAM role. The documentation mentions that users who have been using Autopilot in Studio Classic and want to migrate to SageMaker Canvas might need to grant additional permissions to their user profile or IAM role to create and use the SageMaker Canvas application. This suggests that Canvas should be accessible from your existing domain once proper permissions are configured.\nSources\nSageMaker Autopilot - Amazon SageMaker AI\nAutomated ML, no-code, or low-code - Amazon SageMaker AI"
