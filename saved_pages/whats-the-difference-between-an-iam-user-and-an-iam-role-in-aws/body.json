  "body": "What\u2019s the difference between an IAM User and an IAM Role in AWS?\nI\u2019m a bit confused. Both IAM Users and IAM Roles allow access to AWS services, but how do they differ in practice? When should I use one over the other?\n\nThe key differences between IAM Users and IAM Roles are:\nAssociation\n: An IAM User is uniquely associated with a single person or application, while an IAM Role is designed to be assumable by anyone who needs it (users, applications, or services).\nCredentials\n: IAM Users have permanent, long-term credentials such as passwords and access keys. IAM Roles provide temporary security credentials that are valid only for a role session.\nUse cases\n:\nUse IAM Users when you have specific use cases that require long-term credentials (though AWS recommends rotating access keys regularly).\nUse IAM Roles for temporary access scenarios such as federated user access, cross-account access, or for AWS services to perform actions on your behalf.\nAs a best practice, AWS recommends using temporary credentials (IAM Roles) whenever possible instead of creating IAM Users with long-term credentials. IAM Roles are particularly useful for delegation, allowing entities that don't normally have access to your AWS resources to obtain temporary permissions.\nFor example, if you need to grant access to multiple users with similar permissions, you could create an IAM Role with those permissions and have users assume that role when needed, rather than creating individual IAM Users and managing their credentials.\nSources\nCompare IAM identities and credentials - AWS Identity and Access Management\nWhen do I use IAM? - AWS Identity and Access Management\nIAM roles - AWS Identity and Access Management\nAWS Identity and Access Management for AWS Security Hub - AWS Security Hub"
