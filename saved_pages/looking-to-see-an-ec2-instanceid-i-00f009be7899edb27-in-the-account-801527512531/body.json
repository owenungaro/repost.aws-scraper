However, since you can't see it in the EC2 console, there are several possible explanations and troubleshooting steps you can take:\nRegion Check: First, confirm you're looking in the correct AWS region (us-west-2). Your CloudTrail log indicates this is the region where the instance was created.\nInstance State: The instance may have been stopped or terminated after creation. Check for stopped or terminated instances in the EC2 dashboard, as these might not appear in the default \"Running instances\" view.\nEC2 Global View: Use the EC2 Global View feature to see all your EC2 resources across all regions. This can help determine if the instance exists in a different region.\nCheck CloudTrail for Termination: Look for a \"TerminateInstances\" event in CloudTrail that might indicate the instance was terminated shortly after creation.\nData Pipeline Automation: Since the instance was created by Data Pipeline (as shown by the \"invokedBy\": \"datapipeline.amazonaws.com\" in your CloudTrail log), it's possible that the pipeline was configured to terminate the instance after completing its task. This is common for temporary workloads.\nPermissions Issue: Verify that you have the necessary IAM permissions to view EC2 instances in this account.\nFilters in Console: Make sure no filters are applied in the EC2 dashboard that might be hiding your instance.\nIf you still can't locate the instance after these steps, you might want to check the Data Pipeline configuration to understand the lifecycle management of resources it creates, as it may have been programmed to terminate instances automatically after task completion.\nSources\nEC2 Instance not visible on EC2 Dashboard on my account | AWS re:Post\nMy amazon aws ec2 instance disappeared or got replaced | AWS re:Post\nEC2 Instance is not visible | AWS re:Post\n\nYou have shared only part of the cloudtrail event. Does the event say \"i-00f009be7899edb27\" is created. Does it have any error messages - search for\nerrorCode\nor\nerrorMessages\nin cloudtrail event."
