  "body": "I have a bedrock knowledge base connected to S3 instance, and I am trying to trigger a sync on the knowledge base data store. However, the sync fails every time citing a metadata error on a specific pdf file. So, I went ahead and deleted this file, along with its metadata file from my S3 instance, and then triggered a sync again on the bedrock knowledge base data store. However, the sync keeps failing and now I get a new error called \"Partially Indexed\" on the same file, although I have permanently deleted it from my S3 instance along with its associated metadata. How can I resolve this issue and trigger a successful sync on the Bedrock Knowledge Base? If anyone can help me out here, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nWhen you're experiencing issues with a Bedrock Knowledge Base sync showing \"PARTIALLY_INDEXED\" status for a file that you've already deleted from S3, this indicates a synchronization issue between your S3 bucket and the knowledge base.\nThe \"PARTIALLY_INDEXED\" status means that some chunks of the document were successfully indexed while others failed. This can happen when there are inconsistencies between the previous version of the file and the current state of your S3 bucket.\nHere are some steps to resolve this issue:\nUnderstand the incremental syncing process\n: Bedrock implements incremental syncing, which means it only processes files that have been added, modified, or deleted since the last sync. When files are overwritten (rather than deleted and re-uploaded), this can sometimes cause issues if the number of chunks differs between versions.\nCheck CloudWatch logs\n: Review the CloudWatch logs for your knowledge base to see the specific error messages related to the failed sync. This might provide more details about why the file is still showing as \"PARTIALLY_INDEXED\" despite being deleted.\nTry a complete resync\n: Instead of an incremental sync, you might need to perform a complete resync of your knowledge base. This can be done by:\nTemporarily moving all files out of the S3 bucket\nTriggering a sync (which should remove all documents)\nMoving the files back (excluding the problematic one)\nTriggering another sync\nCheck for metadata inconsistencies\n: If you were using metadata files with your documents, ensure that all associated metadata files are also properly deleted.\nVerify permissions\n: Ensure that the IAM role associated with your knowledge base has all the necessary permissions for S3 operations, including delete operations.\nConsider recreating the knowledge base\n: If all else fails, you might need to create a new knowledge base with the same configuration and data source, which would start with a clean slate.\nThe issue you're experiencing is likely related to how Bedrock tracks document versions and changes. When files are overwritten rather than deleted and re-uploaded, the system sometimes has difficulty reconciling the differences, especially if the chunking of the document changes.\nSources\nAWS Bedrock Knowledge Base not syncing when files are being over-written in S3 Bucket | AWS re:Post\nIncremental Syncing of Metadata files | AWS re:Post\nKnowledgeBaseDocumentDetail - Amazon Bedrock"
