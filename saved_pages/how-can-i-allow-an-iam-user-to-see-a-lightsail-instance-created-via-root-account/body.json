Please try a smaller plan size or contact Customer Support\nif you need to use a larger plan. - An attempt to create the $12 90 day trial lightsail instance, with an IAM user.\nI created the lower plan, to run testing with Plesk before purchasing, however, I quickly ran into the issue of Plesk consistently freezing, due to ram limitations.\nI switched over to root, to see if I could adjust and saw the option to create the $12 instance and decided to do so, to give my IAM user access. The instance was created, but could not be found by the IAM user with AdministratorAccess permissions, even though they are in the same region - Virginia Zone A.\nUpon creating this 2nd 90 day trial via root, I received an email from AWS, for cost anomaly detection. I want to avoid charge issues, before being able to properly test lightsail with Plesk by removing the $7 plan, created by the IAM user, but keeping the $12 plan created on root, while allowing the IAM user to actually see the instance.\nRoot cannot see the $7 instance created by IAM user.\nIAM user cannot see the $12 instance created by root.\n\nYeah, Lightsail is a bit of a black box when it comes to IAM permissions, much more limited compared to full EC2. Even if your IAM user has AdministratorAccess, Lightsail still doesn\u2019t support resource-level permissions the way you'd expect.\nBasically, Lightsail resources (like instances) are isolated per user, even within the same AWS account. So if the root user creates an instance, IAM users won\u2019t see it by default, and vice versa. It's not a region issue, it's just how Lightsail handles scoping.\nA few things you can try:\nSwitch to full EC2 if you need proper shared access and fine-grained IAM control. Yes, it's more complex, but worth it for team workflows. If you must stick with Lightsail, you\u2019ll need to use root for managing shared instances. IAM users are practically second-class citizens here.\nYou can script interactions via the AWS CLI using the root credentials (with proper caution) if the goal is just to enable some automation or visibility.\nI'd recommend deleting the unused instance ASAP to avoid extra charges, trial or not."
