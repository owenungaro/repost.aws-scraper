I heard CloudWatch is the way to do that, but I\u2019m not sure how to find or use the logs.\nCan someone walk me through it like I\u2019m brand new?\n\nAs a beginner looking to view your Lambda function logs in CloudWatch, you have several straightforward options:\nUsing the Lambda console:\nGo to the Lambda console\nSelect your function\nChoose the \"Monitor\" tab\nView the execution results in the \"Logs\" section\nYou can also check the \"Details\" section when using the console test feature\nUsing the CloudWatch console:\nOpen the CloudWatch console\nNavigate to the \"Log groups\" page\nFind and select the log group for your Lambda function (it will have your function's name)\nClick on a log stream to see the detailed logs\nUsing the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI):\nIf you're comfortable with command-line tools, you can retrieve logs using the AWS CLI with the --log-type command option.\nWhat you'll see in the logs:\nLambda automatically logs the start and end of each function invocation\nYou'll see details like request ID, duration, memory usage, and more\nAny console.log statements (or equivalent in your programming language) will appear in these logs\nEach log stream corresponds to an instance of your function, and AWS Lambda automatically monitors and sends these logs to CloudWatch without any additional setup required on your part.\nSources\nLog and monitor Go Lambda functions - AWS Lambda\nViewing CloudWatch logs for Lambda functions - AWS Lambda\nLog and monitor Node.js Lambda functions - AWS Lambda\nWorking with Lambda function logs - AWS Lambda"
