  "body": "Hi,\nI'm new to AWS and I'm having trouble with the hello_s3 c++ test code. I can get it to compile and run, but it says authentication has failed. I have run \"aws configure\" and entered in the data in the .csv file I downloaded after following the instructions on this web page:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/access-iam-users.html\n.\nIs there something else I need to do to get my C++ program to authenticate properly?\nThanks,\nJohn\n\nWhen you're experiencing authentication issues with the AWS SDK for C++, there are several things to check:\nFirst, ensure your credentials are properly set up. The AWS SDK for C++ uses the DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain, which looks for credentials in the following order:\nEnvironment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)\nAWS credentials file (~/.aws/credentials on Linux/Mac or %USERPROFILE%.aws\\credentials on Windows)\nIAM role for Amazon EC2 (if running on EC2)\nVerify that your credentials file is correctly formatted. After running \"aws configure\", it should have created a file with a structure like:\n[default]\naws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY\naws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY\nregion = YOUR_REGION\nCheck if your credentials have the necessary permissions. Even though you've downloaded credentials, the IAM user might not have the required permissions to access S3 services.\nYou can test if your credentials are working with the AWS CLI by running:\naws sts get-caller-identity\nThis will show you which identity you're authenticated as.\nIf you're using temporary credentials, they might have expired. Temporary credentials include an additional session token and have a limited lifetime.\nIf you're running your application in a specific region, make sure to set the region in your client configuration:\nclientConfig.region = \"your-region\";\nThe hello_s3.cpp example you're using actually includes a helpful check that explicitly tests authentication before attempting to list buckets, which is why you're seeing the \"Failed authentication\" message rather than just getting zero buckets returned.\nSources\nAuthenticate AWS credentials without secret key and access key using AWS SDK for Java | AWS re:Post\nCan we provide temporary access key,ID and session token in AWS Credentials File | AWS re:Post\nAmazon S3 examples using SDK for C++ - AWS SDK Code Examples\nAWS was not able to validate the provided access credentials | AWS re:Post"
