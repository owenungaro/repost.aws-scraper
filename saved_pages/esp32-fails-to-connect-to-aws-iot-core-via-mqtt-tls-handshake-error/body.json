  "body": "I'm working on an IoT project where I use an ESP32 to send temperature and humidity data from a DHT22 sensor to AWS IoT Core using MQTT over TLS.\nI\u2019ve already:\nRegistered a Thing in AWS IoT Core\nCreated and attached an IoT policy that allows iot:Connect, iot:Publish, and iot:Subscribe\nUploaded the root CA, private key, and certificate to the ESP32\nUsed WiFiClientSecure and PubSubClient libraries in Arduino IDE\nProblem:\nSometimes the ESP32 connects and sends data successfully, but often it fails to connect, and I see this error in serial output:\nMQTT connection failed\nTLS handshake failed\nWhat I've tried:\nVerified the certificate and policy permissions\nSynced ESP32 time using NTP (but not always consistent)\nIncreased buffer size in PubSubClient\nChecked endpoint and port (8883) are correct\nQuestions:\nWhat are the best practices to ensure a reliable TLS connection between ESP32 and AWS IoT Core?\nHow can I properly debug or log TLS handshake failures on the ESP32?\nAre there lightweight alternatives to WiFiClientSecure that work well with AWS IoT?\n\nTo ensure a reliable TLS connection between your ESP32 and AWS IoT Core, and to address the issues you're experiencing, consider the following best practices and troubleshooting steps:\nEndpoint Verification: Double-check that you're using the correct endpoint. The IoT Core endpoint should end with \"-ats.iot.[region].amazonaws.com\". Using an incorrect endpoint can cause connection failures.\nCertificate Chain: Ensure you're using the correct root CA certificate. For AWS IoT Core, you should be using the Amazon Root CA 1 certificate. Make sure this certificate is properly chained with your device certificate.\nTime Synchronization: Accurate time is crucial for TLS handshakes. While you mentioned using NTP, ensure it's consistently working. Consider implementing a retry mechanism if the initial time sync fails.\nMemory Management: ESP32 has limited memory. Increase the stack size for the task handling MQTT connections if possible. Also, ensure you're not running out of heap memory.\nConnection Retry Logic: Implement a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff. Sometimes, the first connection attempt may fail, but subsequent attempts succeed.\nTLS Version: Ensure you're using TLS 1.2 or later, as required by AWS IoT Core.\nBuffer Sizes: While you've increased the PubSubClient buffer size, also check the WiFiClientSecure buffer sizes. Insufficient buffer size can cause handshake failures.\nDebugging TLS Handshake:\nEnable verbose logging in WiFiClientSecure if available.\nUse a logic analyzer to capture the communication between ESP32 and the network interface for detailed analysis.\nImplement more granular error reporting in your code to identify at which stage the handshake is failing.\nAlternative Libraries: Consider using the AWS IoT Device SDK for Embedded C, which is designed to work well with resource-constrained devices like ESP32. It provides better error handling and debugging capabilities for AWS IoT specific operations.\nPower Supply: Ensure your ESP32 has a stable power supply. Fluctuations can cause intermittent connection issues.\nNetwork Stability: Check your network connection stability. Intermittent network issues can cause TLS handshake failures.\nCertificate and Key Verification: Double-check that the certificate and private key on the ESP32 match those registered in AWS IoT Core.\nPolicy Verification: Although you've created a policy, verify that it's correctly attached to the certificate used by your device.\nJust-in-Time Registration: If you're using Just-in-Time Registration (JITR), be aware that the first connection attempt will fail by design. Ensure your code can handle this and retry the connection.\nBy systematically addressing these points, you should be able to improve the reliability of your ESP32's connection to AWS IoT Core and better diagnose any remaining issues.\nSources\nCertificate issue with ESP32 using MQTTClient | AWS re:Post\nProvisioning identity in AWS IoT Core for device connections - Device Manufacturing and Provisioning with X.509 Certificates in AWS IoT Core\nCan't Connect to IOT Endpoint | AWS re:Post\nIoT core connection with MQTT explorer | AWS re:Post\n\nnice answer, i can implement and testing your recomendation"
