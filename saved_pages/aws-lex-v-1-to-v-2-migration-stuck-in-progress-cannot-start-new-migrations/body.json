  "body": "Hello AWS Team,\nI initiated a migration for my Lex V1 bot to V2 and it is stuck in\nIN_PROGRESS\nstate for over 3 Days now. The migration ID is:\nCTSOWYF94Y\n,\nPAJEW836CI\n,\nUDZOAOMAK2\nThis is blocking me from further migrations. I am on the Basic Support plan and cannot raise a technical support ticket directly.\nCould someone from AWS cancel the stuck migration job or guide me on how to proceed?\n\nI understand your frustration with the migration process being stuck. This is indeed a challenging situation, especially when you're unable to start new migrations. Let me provide some guidance based on the information available:\nMigration Status: The \"IN_PROGRESS\" status you're seeing indicates that the migration is still ongoing according to the system. Normally, when a migration is complete, the status should change to \"COMPLETED\". The fact that it's been stuck for over 3 days suggests there might be an underlying issue.\nCancellation: Unfortunately, there isn't a direct way for users to cancel an ongoing migration. This is a limitation of the current system.\nTroubleshooting Steps:\na. Check IAM Permissions: Ensure that your IAM user or role has the necessary permissions for both Amazon Lex V1 and V2 API operations. Insufficient permissions can lead to migration failures or delays.\nb. Review Bot Configuration: Check if your V1 bot contains any features or configurations that might not be directly compatible with V2. This could potentially cause the migration to hang.\nc. Check for Alerts: During the migration process, Amazon Lex may generate alerts for resources it can't migrate. These could be ERROR alerts (which stop the migration) or WARN alerts (which allow the migration to continue but require manual changes).\nNext Steps:\na. Wait a bit longer: Sometimes, complex migrations can take an extended time. If possible, wait for a few more hours to see if the status changes.\nb. Attempt a New Migration: Try initiating a new migration for a different bot or version. This might help determine if the issue is specific to this particular migration or a more general problem.\nc. Contact AWS Support: Even though you're on the Basic Support plan, you can still use the AWS Support Center to submit a case. While you may not get direct technical support, you can report the issue, which might be escalated if it's determined to be a system-wide problem.\nFuture Migrations: To avoid similar issues in the future, consider breaking down your bot into smaller components if possible, and migrate them separately. This can help isolate potential issues and make the process more manageable.\nRemember, Amazon Lex strongly recommends using V2 for all new bots and upgrading existing ones, as V1 will no longer be supported after September 15, 2025. Despite the current difficulty, completing the migration to V2 will provide access to the latest improvements and capabilities of Amazon Lex.\nSources\nerror while migrating bot from lex v1 to v2 | AWS re:Post\nMigrating a bot - Amazon Lex V1\nMigrationSummary - Amazon Lex V1\nStartMigration - Amazon Lex V1\n\nCan you provide Account and region details so we can track it down?\n\nOkay I looked the stuck migrations. The reason its not working is because we are hitting an NPE exception. The NPE stems from the fact that your V1 bots have some image response cards where title is null, which is a required field in LexV2 ImageResponseCards. I have marked the migrations as Failed so you can try again. Make sure to fix your existing imageResponseCards before you retry migration."
