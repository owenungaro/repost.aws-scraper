  "body": "Dear AWS SES Team,\nI am reaching out as an active and responsible user of Amazon SES to express concern about the ongoing issue of automatic approvals for Production Access.\nWhile I understand the intent behind streamlining access, it appears that a growing number of newly approved accounts are being used for abusive purposes \u2014 including spam and bulk marketing \u2014 often by users who later sell these pre-approved SES accounts on underground forums.\nAs a result, legitimate SES users like myself are facing degraded email deliverability, increased risk of blacklisting, and serious disruption in communications with our customers.\nI kindly request that AWS:\nReassess the current automatic Production Access policy;\nIntroduce stronger identity and business verification steps;\nTake visible steps to limit abuse and protect the platform\u2019s reputation.\nI strongly believe these changes would help restore fairness and reliability for authentic AWS users who depend on SES for compliant and professional communication.\nThank you for your attention and for your continued support of the AWS community.\nSincerely.\n\nThank you for bringing this to our attention. We will investigate and take appropriate actions accordingly."
