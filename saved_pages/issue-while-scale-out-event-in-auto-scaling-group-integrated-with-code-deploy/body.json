  "body": "Hello, I have a code deploy application and deployment group configured, with a auto scaling group. When I increase the desired instance count in auto scaling group, I can see an auto-scaling group action in code deploy which deploys my code on the instance, I also validated the instance Id from auto-scaling activities tab, but after a minute or two, the same instance gets terminated, and this is the message in auto-scaling activities tab:\n\"an instance was taken out of service in response to a launch failure\". I checked the state transition reason in the terminated instance, it shows it is User initiated. I confirmed that the code deploy agent is installed and running on the newly created instance. I checked the IAM role, it has access to S3 buckets where revision is stored. I also checked the security group and outbound rules for the instance and it allows https. I also checked the availability region of my sub net and the auto-scaling group, both are set for the same regions. What am I missing?\n\nWhat's the cause listed on the launch failure?  Does it say \"Due to ABANDON\"?  If so, then the Deployment in CodeDeploy is failing, and CodeDeploy is telling ASG to fail the launch (by sending a complete-lifecycle-action call with ABANDON as the result).  Check the Deployment to see which step its failing at.  For more details, you'll need to get the deployment logs from inside the instance.\nIf you're not automatically pushing these out, then you'll need to save the instance before its terminated, or set its EBS volume to not be deleted on instance termination. The simplest option is to quickly send a complete-lifecycle-action call with CONTINUE, and then detach the instance from the ASG.  The Deployment in CodeDeploy will still continue, but it'll be a standalone EC2 instance, so it won't be terminated when the deployment fails, and you can take look in the logs to see what happened\n\nHello, there are a few different things that are happening, when ASG is sending scaling group action to code deploy.\nASG sends termination signal even before reaching the script, the applicationStop life cycle started at 12:02 and took less than a second, but the next lifecycle which is DownloadBundle started at 12:07 during which the termination event arrived. code deploy did not reach my script\nASG sends termination event when the script is running\nIn both cases my script did not complete.\n\nWhat are the full \"Cause\" and \"Description\" fields?  (redacting out any sensitive info)\nThese should give more info on why the launch failed\n\nDuring the download bundle failure:\nCodeDeploy agent was not able to receive the lifecycle event. Check the CodeDeploy agent logs on your host and make sure the agent is running and can connect to the CodeDeploy server.\nand during the afterInstall failure:\n[stderr]\n[stderr]Session terminated, killing shell... ...killed.\nthere were some more errors:\nduring AllowTraffic:\n1.The EC2 instance did not turn into the expected healthy state in target group. In \"ASG_GROUP\": {State: unused,Reason: Target.NotRegistered,Description: Target is not registered to the target group} timed out when trying to achieve ELB registration goal.\n2. The following targets are not in a running state and cannot be registered: 'INSTANCE_ID'\n\nCodeDeploy agent was not able to receive the lifecycle event\nThis sounds like the main issue.  If the Agent didn't connect correctly, it wouldn't be able to send a heartbeat to the ASG to extend the hook timeout.  Make sure the most up to date version of the Agent is installed.  Also make sure the instance has outbound connectivity.\nIf that doesn't fix it, you might want to open a support case so someone can take a look at your actual resources to troubleshoot in more detail\n\nBased on the information provided, it appears you're experiencing an issue with your Auto Scaling group where new instances are being terminated shortly after launch during a scale-out event. This problem can occur for several reasons, and here are some potential causes and solutions to consider:\nCodeDeploy Deployment Failure: It's possible that the CodeDeploy deployment is failing on the new instance, causing the Auto Scaling group to mark it as unhealthy and terminate it. Check the CodeDeploy logs on the instance (if possible before termination) or in CloudWatch Logs for any deployment errors.\nInstance Health Checks: Ensure that your Auto Scaling group's health check grace period is long enough to allow the CodeDeploy deployment to complete. If the grace period is too short, the instance might be terminated before the deployment finishes.\nApplication Startup Issues: If your application fails to start properly after deployment, it could cause the instance to fail health checks. Review your application logs for any startup errors.\nIAM Permissions: While you mentioned checking IAM roles for S3 access, ensure that the instance role has all necessary permissions for both CodeDeploy and your application to function correctly.\nNetwork Configuration: Verify that the instance can communicate with all required services and endpoints. This includes CodeDeploy service endpoints, your application dependencies, and any other AWS services you're using.\nResource Constraints: Check if there are any resource constraints (e.g., CPU, memory) that might be causing the application or CodeDeploy agent to fail.\nLifecycle Hooks: If you're using Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks, ensure they are configured correctly and not causing unexpected behavior.\nCodeDeploy Agent Issues: Although you confirmed the agent is installed and running, check if it's the latest version and properly configured.\nTo troubleshoot further:\nIncrease logging verbosity for CodeDeploy and your application.\nTemporarily disable automatic termination of unhealthy instances to give you more time to investigate.\nReview the CodeDeploy deployment logs in detail.\nCheck the system logs of the instance for any errors or warnings.\nVerify that all necessary ports are open in your security groups for both inbound and outbound traffic.\nConsider using EC2 Instance Connect or Systems Manager Session Manager to access the instance before it terminates to gather more information.\nIf the issue persists after checking these areas, you may need to engage AWS support for a more in-depth investigation of your specific configuration and deployment process.\nSources\nTroubleshoot Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling issues - AWS CodeDeploy\nCodedeploy fails when autoscaling group is empty | AWS re:Post\nWhy is my Auto Scaling group not launching new instances when the load increases? | AWS re:Post"
