  "body": "We are running a multi-region architecture where our application in the US East (N. Virginia) Region processes data stored in an S3 bucket located in the EU (Frankfurt) Region. This has resulted in significant cross-region data transfer costs .\nwe also have data residency policies that prevent us from relocating all data to a single Region.\nWhat will be the best practices or architectural patterns to reduce these costs?\nCan we use AWS PrivateLink, S3 Replication, or S3 Access Points to help?\nAre there caching or edge computing strategies (e.g., Lambda@Edge, CloudFront) that could minimize repeated cross-region fetches?\nHow can we maintain compliance while improving performance and reducing cost?\n\nWorth taking a look at this:\nUse S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) Strategically\nSince you can\u2019t move all data to one region, replicate only the subset of data needed for processing in the US East (N. Virginia) region using S3 CRR. This avoids repeated cross-region fetches and reduces transfer costs over time.\nCache with CloudFront or Lambda@Edge\n\u2022\tLeverage CloudFront to cache S3 content at edge locations near your EC2 instances.\n\u2022\tLeveraging Lambda@Edge can preprocess or filter data before it hits your app.\nPrivateLink may not benefit here since it doesn\u2019t reduce inter-region transfer costs.\nConsider S3 Access Points for Fine-Grained Access\nS3 Access Points help manage access policies per application or team, but do not directly reduce transfer costs. However, they can help enforce data residency boundaries by restricting access to region-specific endpoints.\nAnalyze and Model Transfer Costs\n\u2022\tCost and Usage Reports (CUR)\n\u2022\tCUDOS Dashboard (via QuickSight)\n\u2022\tAthena queries to identify top transfer sources/destinations\nArchitect for Local Processing\nIf feasible, shift compute to the data instead of pulling data to compute. For example, spin up EC2 or Lambda in Frankfurt to pre-process or filter data before sending only the results to N. Virginia.\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/analyze-data-transfer-and-adopt-cost-optimized-designs-to-realize-cost-savings/\n\nFor compliance + cost + performance, bringing compute to the data is almost always better than bringing data to the compute.\nFor real time data processing, you can write a lambda function with api gateway in Frankfurt region ad invoke the API from EC2. You can set caching for API. This ideal for compliance and cost control.\nS3 replication and CloudFront does not help with compliance since the data will be temporarily stored in a different region. S3 access point won't reduce cost."
