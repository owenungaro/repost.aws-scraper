  "body": "Hi team, I'm new to Amazon. I have been working on Amazon Q for past 3 days. I have been chatting with Q for app modernization. For past two days I was able to login via(Use with Pro license) and was able to chat. Today when I login, I'm facing \"error: dispatch failure\" on my Windows Shell. I'm using Windows 11 and Ubuntu as my Subsystem. Is anyone know how to fix this error. I have re-started my system for 3 times, still facing this issue.\nThanks,\nRamji\n\nI apologize that you're experiencing this issue with Amazon Q. While I don't have specific information about the \"dispatch failure\" error you're encountering, I can suggest some general troubleshooting steps that might help resolve your login problem:\nClear your browser cache and cookies: Sometimes, clearing your browser's cache and cookies can resolve login issues. Try this and then attempt to log in again.\nTry a different browser: If clearing the cache and cookies doesn't work, try using a different web browser to see if the issue persists. For example, if you're using Microsoft Edge, try Google Chrome, or vice versa.\nDisable browser extensions: Temporarily disable any browser extensions, especially ad blockers or privacy extensions, as these might interfere with the login process.\nCheck your subscription status: Ensure that your Amazon Q subscription is still active. You can do this by signing in to the AWS access portal or the Amazon Q subscription console.\nWait for subscription activation: If you've recently been added to a group for Amazon Q access, it can take up to 24 hours for your subscription to activate fully.\nVerify you're in the correct AWS Region: Make sure you're trying to sign in to the application in the same AWS Region where your AWS IAM Identity Center instance is located.\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, I recommend contacting your Amazon Q administrator or IT department for further assistance. They may need to check your account permissions or investigate any potential system-wide issues.\nAdditionally, if you're able to access the Amazon Q web experience, try having a conversation there first before attempting to use any integrated tools or extensions. This sometimes helps resolve login issues with connected applications.\nIf the problem persists, your administrator may need to contact AWS support for more specialized assistance with this specific error message.\nSources\nTroubleshoot Amazon Q Developer authentication errors in IDE | AWS re:Post\nCannot Log Into AmazonQ Web Experience Link | AWS re:Post\nTroubleshooting the Amazon Q Business Add-in for Microsoft Word - Amazon Q Business\nTroubleshooting the Amazon Q Business app for Microsoft Teams - Amazon Q Business"
