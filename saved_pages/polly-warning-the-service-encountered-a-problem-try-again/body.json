  "body": "I got a red warning when clicked on Polly (\nWarning.  The service encountered a problem.  Try again\n).  I'm not able to use Polly TTS to transcribe text to mp3 file.  Any ideas?\n\nCan you share more details? Does it happen for various texts, voices, engine? Or just one specific combination? Does it work at all ever?\n\nBased on the error message you're receiving when trying to use Amazon Polly, there could be a few potential causes:\nIAM Permissions Issue\n: You might not have the correct permissions to access the Amazon Polly service. If you're using an IAM user account, your administrator needs to ensure you have the appropriate permissions. This could be done by attaching the \"AmazonPollyFullAccess\" policy to your user or by creating a custom policy that grants specific Polly permissions.\nService Availability\n: There might be a temporary issue with the Amazon Polly service in your region. In this case, waiting and trying again later might resolve the problem.\nInput Text Format\n: If you're using SSML tags in your input text, make sure they're properly formatted. Special characters like \"<\", \">\", and \"'\" need to be escaped in SSML to avoid \"Invalid SSML request\" errors.\nBrowser Issues\n: Try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser to access the Polly console.\nIf the issue persists, you might want to check the AWS Service Health Dashboard to see if there are any known issues with Polly, or contact AWS Support for further assistance.\nSources\nAccessing AWS Service Polly as IAM user | AWS re:Post\nHow to use Amazon Polly to resolve common implementation challenges | AWS re:Post"
