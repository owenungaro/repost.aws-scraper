I have tried to query the csv file using s3 object and it doesn't allow me to do that either. How can I fix this?\n\nHello.\nDoes the IAM role configured for the Glue crawler have the necessary IAM policies to read files from S3?\nA common reason why tables cannot be created with the Glue crawler is due to incorrect IAM role configuration.\nhttps://repost.aws/questions/QU5A9IETLQQ52BgrjBJZJFrQ/aws-glue-crawler-not-creating-table\nhttps://repost.aws/knowledge-center/glue-crawler-not-adding-new-partitions\nAlso, when you run a crawl, logs are likely to be output to CloudWatch Logs, so there is a chance that errors will be recorded in those logs.\nSo, please check the logs output to CloudWatch Logs.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/logging-and-monitoring.html\n\nIt was not creating the table due to the not having the correct IAM policies. I thought updating the IAM permissions would do that. Thank you very much!\n\nTo create a table from a CSV file in S3 using AWS Glue Crawler, follow these steps:\nUpload your CSV file to S3\n:\nEnsure your CSV file is properly formatted with consistent data types.\nIf you want column names to be preserved, make sure your CSV file has a header row.\nCreate and configure a Glue Crawler\n:\nGo to the AWS Glue Console and create a new crawler.\nSet the crawler source type to \"Data Stores\" and specify your S3 bucket path where the CSV file is located.\nConfigure the crawler output to create a new database or use an existing one in the Glue Data Catalog.\nEnsure the IAM role for the crawler has the necessary permissions to access your S3 bucket.\nRun the crawler\n:\nStart the crawler job to scan your CSV file.\nThe crawler will infer the schema from your data and create a table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.\nIf your crawler isn't creating the table, check these common issues:\nPermissions\n: Ensure the IAM role used by the crawler has proper permissions to access your S3 bucket and create tables in the Glue Data Catalog.\nFile format\n: Make sure your CSV file is properly formatted. If the header row is missing, the crawler will create generic column names like c_0, c_1, etc.\nFile location\n: Verify the S3 path provided to the crawler is correct and contains your CSV file.\nCSV format\n: If your CSV uses non-standard delimiters or has other formatting peculiarities, the crawler might have trouble inferring the schema.\nOnce the table is created, you can query it using Amazon Athena with standard SQL statements. If you're still having issues, you can also manually create a table definition in Athena using a CREATE TABLE statement that specifies the column names, data types, and location of your CSV file in S3.\nSources\nReading archived S3 objects with Standard storage class - AWS Prescriptive Guidance\nQuery data from multiple sources in S3 on Athena? | AWS re:Post\nCommunity | What happens when you run a query in Amazon Athena?"
