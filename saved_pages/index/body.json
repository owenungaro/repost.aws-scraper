  "body": "IAM Policies Overview\nIAM policies are JSON documents that define permissions for AWS resources. They control access by:\nAttaching to IAM identities (users, groups, roles)\nDefining allowed/denied actions on specific resources\nSupporting multiple permissions within a single policy\nAWS supports several policy types:\nIdentity-based policies (managed or inline)\nResource-based policies\nPermissions boundaries\nService control policies (SCPs)\nResource control policies (RCPs)\nAccess control lists (ACLs)\nSession policies\nWhen creating policies, follow the principle of least privilege - grant only permissions required to perform specific tasks. Start with minimal permissions and add more as needed.\n[\n1\n] [\n2\n]\nPolicy Validation and Testing\nAWS automatically validates IAM policies when created or edited through the Management Console to ensure compliance with IAM policy grammar. Additional validation features:\nIAM Access Analyzer provides policy checks with recommendations\nValidates ARN formatting, action names, and condition keys\nIdentifies syntax and grammar issues\nFor testing policies:\nUse IAM policy simulator (\nhttps://policysim.aws.amazon.com/\n)\nTest identity-based policies and permissions boundaries\nSimulate real-world scenarios with context keys\nView whether actions would be allowed or denied\nNote: The policy simulator doesn't support testing resource-based policies for IAM roles or service control policies with conditions.\n[\n3\n] [\n4\n]\nWas this information helpful?\nYes\nNo"
