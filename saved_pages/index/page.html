Therefore, I would like to migrate my current Cloud9 environment to an EC2 instance.\n\nFor that reason I consider to migrate via Cloned AMI.\n\nProposed Migration Approach:\n1. Create an AMI from the EC2 instance backing the Cloud9 environment (including its root EBS volume).\n2. Launch a new EC2 instance from that AMI in the same VPC/Subnet, with a similar IAM instance profile, and connect through AWS Systems Manager Session Manager.\n3. Post-launch adjustments:\n* Disable the Cloud9 agent to avoid unnecessary processes.\n* Switch from Cloud9’s managed temporary credentials to the instance-profile role or credentials.\n* Confirm whether rerunning cdk bootstrap is required (it is already in place for this account/region).\n\nMy questions are:\n1. Are there any technical or support limitations to cloning the AMI of a Cloud9 instance for development and deployment purposes?\n2. Will the AMI retain all configurations (e.g., IAM policies attached to the Cloud9 instance profile), or do any settings need to be recreated manually?\n3. Does AWS recommend removing or disabling the Cloud9 agent in the new EC2 instance to prevent unnecessary overhead or costs?\n4.  From a billing perspective, will there be additional charges beyond the EBS snapshot and standard EC2/EBS usage?\n5. Are there official guidelines or best-practice documents for migrating from Cloud9 to EC2 while preserving CDK deployment workflows?\n\n\nYour confirmation of the feasibility of this plan, along with any additional recommendations, would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you very much for your assistance.\n\nKind regards,","language":"en","hasAcceptedAnswer":false,"views":56,"type":"Question","createdAt":"2025-05-23T16:24:45.139Z","answers":1,"votes":0,"author":{"id":"USTi7LBUVkQG6eED4vQchkMQ","displayName":"Edgar Arizmendi","isAwsEmployee":false,"isExpert":false,"isCse":false,"isModerator":false,"isCurator":false,"isStar":false,"profilePicture":{}},"tags":[{"id":"TAO-wqN9fYRoyrpdULLa5y7g","name":"Amazon EC2"},{"id":"TA1xhZTtN_TJaYr9I08KzYFg","name":"Amazon Machine Images (AMI)"},{"id":"TAoFRpskalQj2IMqX3US_Ktg","name":"AWS Cloud9"}]},{"id":"QUiHmdc984TpqvSmTdamWfCg","title":"Transfer amplify to another aws account","body":"Hi,\nHow can I transfer an amplify app and route 53 redirection from one aws account to another without using AIM?\nShould I disconnect everything on one account and create it on the other? is there an easier web?\n\nRegards,","language":"en","hasAcceptedAnswer":false,"views":40,"type":"Question","createdAt":"2025-05-23T08:24:46.984Z","answers":1,"votes":0,"author":{"id":"USrOGQW1s5QLOKECko9GB0Cw","displayName":"jsaavedral","isAwsEmployee":false,"isExpert":false,"isCse":false,"isModerator":false,"isCurator":false,"isStar":false,"profilePicture":{}},"tags":[{"id":"TAxd9wmFJAQp-XtLjE63hasw","name":"AWS Amplify"}]},{"id":"QU7f1GIWCmTQ2m42vY3C8Dug","title":"How can I limit users in Braket to running QCs only during reservations?","body":"I would like to restrict users from accessing Braket and running jobs on their own, except during AWS Braket Reservations.

I've configured the SSL settings with the following AT command to enable Server Name Indication (SNI):\n\nAT+CSSLCFG=\"enableSNI\",0,1\n\nDespite this and other configurations, the handshake fails, and I’m unable to establish a secure MQTT connection. The modem responds with an error (specific error code unavailable, but typically ERROR or a connection failure during AT+CMQTTSTART or AT+CMQTTCONNECT).\n\n**Setup Details**\nDevice: SIM7022\nFirmware Version: 2110B07SIM7022\nAWS Service: AWS IoT Core\nProtocol: MQTT\nTLS Version: TLS 1.2\nCertificates: Using AWS IoT certificates (device certificate, private key, and Amazon Root CA 1) downloaded from the AWS IoT Console\nConnection String/Configuration: MQTT client ID configured via AT+CMQTTCLIENTID, endpoint set via AT+CMQTTTOPIC or similar commands\nSteps Taken to Troubleshoot\n\n**I’ve checked the following to resolve the SSL/TLS handshake issue:**\n\nCertificates: Verified that the device certificate, private key, and Amazon Root CA 1 are correctly loaded onto the modem using AT commands (e.g., AT+CSSLCFG=\"cacert\",0,...).\n\nSNI: Enabled SNI using AT+CSSLCFG=\"enableSNI\",0,1 to ensure the hostname is included in the TLS handshake.\n\nSystem Time: Ensured the device’s date and time are correct (synced via NTP or manually set) to avoid certificate validation issues.\n\nTLS Version: Assumed TLS 1.2 is used, as required by AWS IoT Core. [Note: I haven’t explicitly set the TLS version; SIM7022 documentation suggests it defaults to TLS 1.2.]\n\nCipher Suites: Not explicitly configured, relying on the modem’s default cipher suites. [Unsure if SIM7022 supports AWS-compatible ciphers like TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256.]\n\nNetwork: Confirmed network connectivity with AT+CPIN?, AT+CGATT?, and AT+CSQ, ensuring the modem is registered and has a strong signal.\n\nLogs/Debug Info: [Limited logs available; please include any specific error messages, e.g., CME ERROR:  or MQTT-specific errors, if known.]\n\n**Despite these efforts, the handshake still fails. Possible causes I suspect:**\n\nA mismatch in TLS versions or cipher suites between the SIM7022 and AWS IoT Core.\n\nAn issue with the AWS endpoint’s certificate or hostname configuration.\n\nA firmware limitation in the SIM7022 (2110B07SIM7022) or a missing AT command for proper SSL configuration.\n\n**Questions**\n\n\nHas anyone successfully connected a SIM7022 modem (firmware 2110B07SIM7022) to AWS IoT Core using MQTT? If so, what AT commands or configurations were used?\n\n\nAre there specific AT commands for the SIM7022 to set TLS version, cipher suites, or debug SSL handshake issues?\n\n\nCould this be related to AWS IoT Core’s certificate requirements or endpoint configuration?\n\nAny recommendations for debugging the handshake further (e.g., specific SIM7022 AT commands for logs or external tools like Wireshark)?","language":"en","hasAcceptedAnswer":false,"views":71,"type":"Question","createdAt":"2025-05-22T13:38:18.702Z","answers":1,"votes":0,"author":{"id":"USTVwGPYxHST6obHUxPtQFMA","displayName":"Taksh","isAwsEmployee":false,"isExpert":false,"isCse":false,"isModerator":false,"isCurator":false,"isStar":false,"profilePicture":{}},"tags":[{"id":"TAJ7zd4vjzSfC_8JNlsbq2tA","name":"AWS

Therefore, I would like to migrate my current Cloud9 environment to an EC2 instance.\n\nFor that reason I consider to migrate via Cloned AMI.\n\nProposed Migration Approach:\n1. Create an AMI from the EC2 instance backing the Cloud9 environment (including its root EBS volume).\n2. Launch a new EC2 instance from that AMI in the same VPC/Subnet, with a similar IAM instance profile, and connect through AWS Systems Manager Session Manager.\n3. Post-launch adjustments:\n* Disable the Cloud9 agent to avoid unnecessary processes.\n* Switch from Cloud9’s managed temporary credentials to the instance-profile role or credentials.\n* Confirm whether rerunning cdk bootstrap is required (it is already in place for this account/region).\n\nMy questions are:\n1. Are there any technical or support limitations to cloning the AMI of a Cloud9 instance for development and deployment purposes?\n2. Will the AMI retain all configurations (e.g., IAM policies attached to the Cloud9 instance profile), or do any settings need to be recreated manually?\n3. Does AWS recommend removing or disabling the Cloud9 agent in the new EC2 instance to prevent unnecessary overhead or costs?\n4.  From a billing perspective, will there be additional charges beyond the EBS snapshot and standard EC2/EBS usage?\n5. Are there official guidelines or best-practice documents for migrating from Cloud9 to EC2 while preserving CDK deployment workflows?\n\n\nYour confirmation of the feasibility of this plan, along with any additional recommendations, would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you very much for your assistance.\n\nKind regards,","language":"en","hasAcceptedAnswer":false,"views":56,"type":"Question","createdAt":"2025-05-23T16:24:45.139Z","answers":1,"votes":0,"author":{"id":"USTi7LBUVkQG6eED4vQchkMQ","displayName":"Edgar Arizmendi","isAwsEmployee":false,"isExpert":false,"isCse":false,"isModerator":false,"isCurator":false,"isStar":false,"profilePicture":{}},"tags":[{"id":"TAO-wqN9fYRoyrpdULLa5y7g","name":"Amazon EC2"},{"id":"TA1xhZTtN_TJaYr9I08KzYFg","name":"Amazon Machine Images (AMI)"},{"id":"TAoFRpskalQj2IMqX3US_Ktg","name":"AWS Cloud9"}]},{"id":"QUiHmdc984TpqvSmTdamWfCg","title":"Transfer amplify to another aws account","body":"Hi,\nHow can I transfer an amplify app and route 53 redirection from one aws account to another without using AIM?\nShould I disconnect everything on one account and create it on the other? is there an easier web?\n\nRegards,","language":"en","hasAcceptedAnswer":false,"views":40,"type":"Question","createdAt":"2025-05-23T08:24:46.984Z","answers":1,"votes":0,"author":{"id":"USrOGQW1s5QLOKECko9GB0Cw","displayName":"jsaavedral","isAwsEmployee":false,"isExpert":false,"isCse":false,"isModerator":false,"isCurator":false,"isStar":false,"profilePicture":{}},"tags":[{"id":"TAxd9wmFJAQp-XtLjE63hasw","name":"AWS Amplify"}]},{"id":"QU7f1GIWCmTQ2m42vY3C8Dug","title":"How can I limit users in Braket to running QCs only during reservations?","body":"I would like to restrict users from accessing Braket and running jobs on their own, except during AWS Braket Reservations.

Reason: The account-level service limit 'Canvas Apps running on system instances' is 0 Apps, with current utilization of 0 Apps and a request delta of 1 Apps. Please use AWS Service Quotas to request an increase for this quota. If AWS Service Quotas is not available, contact AWS support to request an increase for this quota.\n```\n\n**What I've Tried**\n\nI checked the AWS Service Quotas console for Amazon SageMaker, but I couldn't find the specific quota for Canvas Apps running on system instances.\n\nI ensured I'm in the correct region (eu-north-1, but please let me know if this is region-specific).\n\n**My Goal**\n\nI want to use SageMaker Data Wrangler to process and prepare data for a machine learning project. This is my first time setting up Canvas, so I might be missing something obvious.\n\n**Questions**\n\nHas anyone encountered this error before, and how did you resolve it?\nIs there a specific quota name I should look for in the Service Quotas console for Canvas apps?\nAre there any additional IAM permissions or configurations I need to check?\nIf I need to contact AWS Support, what details should I include to expedite the quota increase process?\n\nAny guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance for your help.","language":"en","hasAcceptedAnswer":true,"views":54,"type":"Question","createdAt":"2025-05-22T17:35:50.526Z","answers":1,"votes":0,"author":{"id":"USTtqfQuwdTgeYV-mwApZoYw","displayName":"Happy Programmer","isAwsEmployee":false,"isExpert":false,"isCse":false,"isModerator":false,"isCurator":false,"isStar":false,"profilePicture":{}},"tags":[{"id":"TAPkLS1Lo3StegvAHHEMH-6A","name":"Amazon SageMaker Canvas"},{"id":"TAgJogswf1TRS7IN8mnfGkAQ","name":"Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler"},{"id":"TA_dl6yFpeQ_SfoM44dVKIkw","name":"Amazon SageMaker Studio"},{"id":"TADDQ1UMGqReet4lBhVAN_5Q","name":"Service Quotas"},{"id":"TAXwEBZll0TtWxbiOoSjJrfw","name":"Machine Learning \u0026 AI"}]},{"id":"ARLhrdl45TRASGkvViwtBG0Q","title":"How do I troubleshoot EKS Auto Mode built-in node pools with Unknown Status","description":"Resolve issues with EKS Auto Mode built-in node pools showing an Unknown status after disabling and re-enabling them.","language":"en","type":"Article","createdAt":"2025-05-22T16:48:45.613Z","updatedAt":"2025-06-13T15:44:31.582Z","votes":0,"views":299,"author":{"id":"USm5H-LPwdSfSL7YhFPCVxYA","displayName":"Olawale","isAwsEmployee":true,"isExpert":true,"isCse":false,"isModerator":false,"isCurator":false,"isStar":false,"profilePicture":{"small":"/media/profilePicture/thumbnails/small/IMbrsMsvHARcqQr9kfo_Z-4Q","original":"/media/profilePicture/original/IMbrsMsvHARcqQr9kfo_Z-4Q","medium":"/media/profilePicture/thumbnails/medium/IMbrsMsvHARcqQr9kfo_Z-4Q"}},"articleType":"COMMUNITY","tags":[{"id":"TA4IvCeWI1TE66q4jEj4Z9zg","name":"Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service"},{"id":"TA5deITQw4QiqAkEN-Cc6u8g","name":"Kubernetes"}]},{"id":"QUoYfYAIejShuFDWFeglzFMQ","title":"Unable to Connect to Redshift ODBC Database  - Error HY000","body":"I am getting the following error when trying to connect to a database after following instructions in the quib and ensuring through the command prompt that the profile setup was successful. \nConnection failed[HY000]: [Redshift][ODBC Driver][Server][860:8:IAMConnectionError]: No AWS profile found: *Profile_Name*","language":"en","hasAcceptedAnswer":true,"views":88,"type":"Question","createdAt":"2025-05-22T16:06:43.256Z","answers":2,"votes":0,"author":{"id":"UShsuOIN-TTWWfEU1N3uDsOw","displayName":"rePost-User-2834877","isAwsEmployee":false,"isExpert":false,"isCse":false,"isModerator":false,"isCurator":false,"isStar":false,"profilePicture":{}},"tags":[{"id":"TAByF7MpfSQUCX_lAeDTvODw","name":"Amazon Redshift"},{"id":"TA-HTDEYY_TMSIibdTHTL6mw","name":"Database"}]},{"id":"QUVMw3MnYmR4K3C6WQdOmHpw","title":"Need Help Escalating SES Production Access – Case ID: ************","body":"Hello AWS Support,\n\nWe are a U.S.-based utility equipment supplier (Enershark LLC) and new AWS customer.

I've configured the SSL settings with the following AT command to enable Server Name Indication (SNI):\n\nAT+CSSLCFG=\"enableSNI\",0,1\n\nDespite this and other configurations, the handshake fails, and I’m unable to establish a secure MQTT connection. The modem responds with an error (specific error code unavailable, but typically ERROR or a connection failure during AT+CMQTTSTART or AT+CMQTTCONNECT).\n\n**Setup Details**\nDevice: SIM7022\nFirmware Version: 2110B07SIM7022\nAWS Service: AWS IoT Core\nProtocol: MQTT\nTLS Version: TLS 1.2\nCertificates: Using AWS IoT certificates (device certificate, private key, and Amazon Root CA 1) downloaded from the AWS IoT Console\nConnection String/Configuration: MQTT client ID configured via AT+CMQTTCLIENTID, endpoint set via AT+CMQTTTOPIC or similar commands\nSteps Taken to Troubleshoot\n\n**I’ve checked the following to resolve the SSL/TLS handshake issue:**\n\nCertificates: Verified that the device certificate, private key, and Amazon Root CA 1 are correctly loaded onto the modem using AT commands (e.g., AT+CSSLCFG=\"cacert\",0,...).\n\nSNI: Enabled SNI using AT+CSSLCFG=\"enableSNI\",0,1 to ensure the hostname is included in the TLS handshake.\n\nSystem Time: Ensured the device’s date and time are correct (synced via NTP or manually set) to avoid certificate validation issues.\n\nTLS Version: Assumed TLS 1.2 is used, as required by AWS IoT Core. [Note: I haven’t explicitly set the TLS version; SIM7022 documentation suggests it defaults to TLS 1.2.]\n\nCipher Suites: Not explicitly configured, relying on the modem’s default cipher suites. [Unsure if SIM7022 supports AWS-compatible ciphers like TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256.]\n\nNetwork: Confirmed network connectivity with AT+CPIN?, AT+CGATT?, and AT+CSQ, ensuring the modem is registered and has a strong signal.\n\nLogs/Debug Info: [Limited logs available; please include any specific error messages, e.g., CME ERROR:  or MQTT-specific errors, if known.]\n\n**Despite these efforts, the handshake still fails. Possible causes I suspect:**\n\nA mismatch in TLS versions or cipher suites between the SIM7022 and AWS IoT Core.\n\nAn issue with the AWS endpoint’s certificate or hostname configuration.\n\nA firmware limitation in the SIM7022 (2110B07SIM7022) or a missing AT command for proper SSL configuration.\n\n**Questions**\n\n\nHas anyone successfully connected a SIM7022 modem (firmware 2110B07SIM7022) to AWS IoT Core using MQTT? If so, what AT commands or configurations were used?\n\n\nAre there specific AT commands for the SIM7022 to set TLS version, cipher suites, or debug SSL handshake issues?\n\n\nCould this be related to AWS IoT Core’s certificate requirements or endpoint configuration?\n\nAny recommendations for debugging the handshake further (e.g., specific SIM7022 AT commands for logs or external tools like Wireshark)?","language":"en","hasAcceptedAnswer":false,"views":71,"type":"Question","createdAt":"2025-05-22T13:38:18.702Z","answers":1,"votes":0,"author":{"id":"USTVwGPYxHST6obHUxPtQFMA","displayName":"Taksh","isAwsEmployee":false,"isExpert":false,"isCse":false,"isModerator":false,"isCurator":false,"isStar":false,"profilePicture":{}},"tags":[{"id":"TAJ7zd4vjzSfC_8JNlsbq2tA","name":"AWS
