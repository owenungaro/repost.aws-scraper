  "body": "We are an SME planning to migrate from on-premise infrastructure to AWS.\nBased on the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF v3) \u2013 Security Perspective, we are focusing on three key areas:\nData Protection\nRegulatory Compliance\nAccess Control\nWhat AWS services are recommended to address these capabilities during a secure migration?\nFor example:\nFor data protection: AWS KMS, Secrets Manager\nFor compliance: AWS Config, Audit Manager\nFor access control: AWS IAM, IAM Identity Center\nAny examples or best practices for how these have been implemented in real-world cloud migration projects, especially in SME environments.\n\nHi,\nGlad the info helped! For SMEs migrating to AWS, I recommend checking out the AWS Solutions Library, which is are free reference architecture and CloudFormation templates tailored for secure migrations, including data protection, compliance automation, and access control setups.\nAlso, AWS offers a free tier on many security services like KMS, Secrets Manager, and Config, which should be sufficient to get started and test your implementations without extra cost.\nAWS Solutions Library -\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/solutions/\nAWS CloudFormation Sample Templates -\nhttps://github.com/awslabs/aws-cloudformation-templates\nAWS Well-Architected Labs -\nhttps://wellarchitectedlabs.com/\n\nHi,\nYour approach is spot on, especially focusing on Data Protection, Compliance, and Access Control. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ve seen these areas tackled in SME migrations:\nAWS KMS and Secrets Manager are essential, as you noted. Also consider AWS CloudHSM if you need dedicated hardware security modules. For data at rest, use encryption options built into services like S3, RDS, and EBS. For data in transit, enable TLS everywhere. Setting up automatic key rotation in KMS adds extra security. Don\u2019t forget to leverage AWS Macie for data discovery and protection of sensitive information.\nAWS Config and Audit Manager work great at continuously assessing and auditing compliance. AWS Security Hub can centralize your security findings across services. For SME projects, I\u2019ve seen organizations automate compliance checks tied to frameworks like HIPAA or GDPR by customizing Config rules and integrating with AWS Lambda for remediation. Documentation and evidentiary reports can be generated via Audit Manager, easing regulatory burdens.\nIAM and IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) provide fine-grained access management. For SMEs, using IAM Identity Center is a smooth way to handle workforce access centrally, especially when integrating with corporate directories. Don\u2019t overlook AWS Organizations for managing multi-account environments securely with Service Control Policies. Using roles with least privilege and MFA everywhere is best practice.\nIf you want, I can share sample architectures or example templates that fit SME setups.\n\nHi Robin,\nYes, thank for your detailed inputs, could you share sample architectures and example templates."
