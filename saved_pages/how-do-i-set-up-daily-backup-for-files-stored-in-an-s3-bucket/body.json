I\u2019m a beginner\u2014can someone walk me through the simplest way to schedule daily backups?\n\nYou can set up daily backups for your S3 bucket using AWS Backup, which is a fully managed service that centralizes and automates data protection across AWS services.\nHere's how to set up daily backups for your S3 bucket:\nFirst, ensure that AWS Backup is configured to work with Amazon S3 by enabling S3 in the AWS Backup settings.\nIn the AWS Backup console, create a backup plan:\nSelect \"Build a new plan\"\nGive your backup plan a name\nConfigure the backup settings:\nCreate a new backup vault or use the default one\nSet the backup frequency to \"Daily\"\nFor the backup window, you can use the defaults (which starts at 5 AM UTC and lasts 8 hours) or customize it\nChoose whether to enable continuous backup for point-in-time recovery (PITR) - note that AWS Backup can back up S3 objects almost continuously every fifteen minutes if you enable this feature\nSet your retention period (how long to keep the backups)\nAssign your S3 bucket to the backup plan. You can select specific buckets or use tags to identify which resources should be backed up.\nOnce configured, AWS Backup will automatically create daily backups of your S3 bucket according to your schedule. These backups are stored in an encrypted backup vault, providing secure storage for your data.\nAs an alternative approach, you could also use Amazon S3's native replication feature to automatically replicate your entire S3 bucket to another bucket in the same or a different AWS Region. This provides a real-time copy of your data rather than point-in-time backups.\nSources\nCommunity | Protecting Amazon S3 Using AWS Backup\nREL09-BP03 Perform data backup automatically - AWS Well-Architected Framework\nREL09-BP03 Perform data backup automatically - AWS Well-Architected Framework"
