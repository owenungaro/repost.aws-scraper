  "body": "Hi Team,\nI have an on-premise Oracle database which uses Oracle Database Vault to protect sensitive data access by privileged DBAs.\nSeems  Database Vault is not supported on RDS Oracle.\nIs there any way I can protect the  sensitive data access by privileged DBAs on RDS Oracle ?\nDoes other RDS engine has any such equivalent feature ?\nThanks!\n\nBased on my experience, I've seen that Oracle Database Vault isn\u2019t available on RDS for Oracle, which means you need to look at different approaches to secure sensitive data against privileged DBA access.\nOne effective alternative is to leverage Oracle\u2019s built-in security features like Fine-Grained Access Control (FGAC) or Virtual Private Database (VPD) using DBMS_RLS. These tools help enforce data access policies dynamically, and I've successfully used them to restrict data visibility.\nI also recommend using Oracle Data Redaction, if your licensing allows it. This feature masks sensitive information in query results, which can be very useful when managing access for privileged users.\nAnother layer of protection is encryption. Using Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) secures data at rest, and while it doesn't block all DBA access, it adds significant protection. Additionally, configuring Oracle Unified Auditing in RDS helps me keep track of any unusual activities by DBAs.\nFor other RDS engines, I've noted that PostgreSQL offers similar functionality with its Row-Level Security and pgAudit, while SQL Server includes options like Always Encrypted and native auditing. These features can provide you with comparable security controls tailored to each platform.\nIn summary, while RDS Oracle doesn't support Database Vault, combining these security features\nFGAC/VPD\n, Data Redaction, TDE, and auditing has worked well in my experience to protect sensitive data even against privileged DBA access."
