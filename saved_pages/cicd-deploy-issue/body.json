  "body": "can somebody help The ELB could not be updated due to the following error: Primary taskset target group must be behind listener arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:ap-southeast-1:791367083955:listener/app/ecs-dev-alb/72bfebe10b8ad3d2/8d5a7b137855163b.\n\nThis error typically occurs during an Amazon ECS deployment using CodeDeploy when there's a configuration issue with the load balancer listeners and target groups. The error message suggests that the primary task set's target group is not properly associated with a listener on your Application Load Balancer (ALB).\nTo resolve this issue, you should:\nVerify that both your production and test listeners are correctly configured and pointing to the appropriate target groups.\nCheck your AppSpec file to ensure that the target group configurations are correct.\nReview your CodeDeploy deployment group settings, particularly the listener configurations.\nEnsure that the IAM roles associated with your CodeDeploy service have the necessary permissions to modify the load balancer and target groups.\nIf you've recently made changes to your load balancer or listener configurations, double-check that these changes are consistent with your deployment setup.\nIf the issue persists after verifying these configurations, you may need to:\nTemporarily suspend and then resume any Auto Scaling processes during the CodeDeploy deployment.\nConsider using the AWS CLI or SDK to manually verify the state of your listeners and target groups.\nReview the CodeDeploy and ECS service logs for any additional error messages or clues.\nIf you're still unable to resolve the issue after these steps, it may be beneficial to open a support case with AWS for a more in-depth investigation, as the root cause could be related to account-specific configurations or recent changes in your deployment process.\nSources\nTroubleshoot Amazon ECS deployment issues - AWS CodeDeploy\n\nHey, looks like the issue is that your ECS service is trying to use a target group that's not actually behind the listener you mentioned.\nI've run into this before, here\u2019s what you can check:\nGo to your ALB in the AWS console, then to Listeners > pick the one from the error, and see if the target group your ECS service uses is actually there.\nIn your ECS service definition, check the loadBalancers section. The target group ARN you\u2019re using there needs to match one that's attached to the listener.\nIf you\u2019re using CodeDeploy with blue/green, make sure the production target group is correctly hooked into the listener in your deployment settings.\nHope that helps! Let me know if you want to walk through the setup \u2014 happy to help.\nSteps:\nValidate Target Group Association:\nMake sure the primary target group is explicitly attached to the ALB listener ARN mentioned:\narn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:ap-southeast-1:791367083955:listener/app/ecs-dev-alb/72bfebe10b8ad3d2/8d5a7b137855163b\nCheck ECS Service Definition:\nIn your ECS service (especially if using blue/green deployments), confirm that the loadBalancers block references the correct target group ARN.\n\"loadBalancers\": [\n{\n\"targetGroupArn\": \"\n<must-match-attached-tg-to-listener>\n\",\n\"containerName\": \"your-container\",\n\"containerPort\": 80\n}\n]\nConfirm Listener Rules:\nGo to the ALB in the AWS Console \u2192 Listeners \u2192 View rules for the specified listener.\nEnsure that the listener is configured to forward traffic to the target group your ECS service expects.\nCI/CD Config (e.g., CodeDeploy):\nIf you're using AWS CodeDeploy for ECS blue/green deployments, ensure that the productionTargetGroup is mapped to the listener properly in the deployment configuration."
