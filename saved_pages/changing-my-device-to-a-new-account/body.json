  "body": "I work at a TV station and was using an AWS elemental live to get a stream out. someone else made the account for that device and they left the organization so i need to change the device to be listed under my account. does anyone know how i go about doing this or do i need to contact AWS support directly and have them do it? thank you for any information provided\n\nYes, you can transfer your AWS Elemental Link device from one AWS account to another. This is a supported feature that makes it easy to transfer device control to a different account, which is particularly useful in situations like yours where the original account owner has left the organization.\nThe process involves transferring the Link device from the previous account to your account. Since this is specifically about AWS Elemental Link devices, this is different from transferring other AWS resources like EC2 instances or AMIs, which would require different procedures.\nTo proceed with the transfer, you'll need access to both the source account (the one currently controlling the device) and your destination account. If you don't have access to the source account because the person left, you may need to work with your IT department to gain appropriate access to that AWS account first, or contact AWS Support for assistance with the transfer process.\nAWS Elemental Link devices are designed to be transferable between accounts to accommodate exactly these types of organizational changes.\nSources\nAWS Elemental Link FAQs\n\nHello.\nCan you sign in to the source AWS account?\nIf you can sign in to the source AWS account and have been granted the appropriate IAM permissions, you should be able to migrate by following the steps outlined in the following AWS blog.\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/media/awse-how-to-transfer-aws-elemental-link-between-aws-accounts/\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/media/awse-how-to-transfer-aws-elemental-link-between-aws-regions/"
