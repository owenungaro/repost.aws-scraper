  "body": "Hello,\nI'm getting an error on a query, even with a single day time frame window. This query has worked previously.  The error being received is:\nAmazon Athena experienced an internal error while executing this query. Please try submitting the query again and if the issue reoccurs, contact AWS support for further assistance. We apologize for the inconvenience.\nThis query ran against the \"_______\" database, unless qualified by the query. Please post the error message on our forum\nor contact customer support\nwith Query Id: abc38451-0fb9-4f9e-b26b-2f2e3024dbe6\nIs it possible to get some details based on that Query Id?\nThanks,\nPete\n\nThe error you're experiencing, \"Amazon Athena experienced an internal error while executing this query,\" is an INTERNAL_ERROR_QUERY_ENGINE error that occurs on the Athena query engine side. This type of error is not typically caused by user input but rather by an issue within Athena's system itself.\nUnfortunately, the Query ID you provided (abc38451-0fb9-4f9e-b26b-2f2e3024dbe6) can only be used by AWS Support to investigate the specific details of your query execution. Regular users don't have access to query execution details using just the Query ID.\nThere are several possible reasons for this error:\nTemporary system issue: These errors can be transient and might resolve by simply retrying the query.\nQuery complexity: Your query might be pushing the limits of Athena's query engine, especially if it involves complex joins or large datasets.\nData issues: There could be unexpected issues with the data you're querying, such as corrupted files or inconsistencies.\nService disruption: There might be ongoing issues with the Athena service in your region.\nTo address this issue, you can try:\nRetry the query: The error might be temporary.\nSimplify the query: Break it down into smaller parts to identify if a specific section is causing the issue.\nCheck your data: Ensure all tables referenced exist and have the expected structure.\nVerify permissions: Make sure your IAM user/role has necessary permissions.\nCheck Athena service status for your region.\nIf the problem persists after trying these steps, contacting AWS Support would be your best option as they can investigate the specific details using your Query ID.\nNote that you won't be charged for queries that result in this error.\nSources\nINTERNAL_ERROR_QUERY_ENGINE | AWS re:Post\nAthena Query: Encountered INTERNAL_ERROR_QUERY_ENGINE Error | AWS re:Post\nATHENA INTERNAL_ERROR_QUERY_ENGINE | AWS re:Post\nQuery fails (inconsistency) after last athena update | AWS re:Post\n\nCan you rerun the query and set the LIMIT to 1. Also check the data source and that there is unexpected files. For example, you may have a file in the data source where there is a schema mismatch."
