  "body": "Hi,\nHow can we install python modules in Glue python shell jobs ?\nThanks in advance\n\nIn AWS Glue Python shell jobs, you can install additional Python modules using the\n--additional-python-modules\njob parameter. This approach works for AWS Glue versions 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0.\nHere's how to install Python modules in Glue Python shell jobs:\nWhen creating or editing your Glue job in AWS Glue Studio, select \"Python Shell script editor\"\nConfigure your job details (name, IAM role, etc.)\nFor Python version, you can choose Python 3.9 which offers a flexible pre-loaded environment\nSelect \"Load common Python libraries\" if you want pre-loaded libraries\nAdd the\n--additional-python-modules\nparameter in the job parameters section with a comma-separated list of the modules you want to install\nFor example, if you want to install the 'textdistance' module, you would add\n--additional-python-modules textdistance==4.2.1\n(specifying the version as needed).\nYou can also use the\n--python-modules-installer-option\nparameter to pass additional options to pip3 when installing the modules.\nThis method works for both standard Python modules and those written in C-based languages. Once configured, you can simply import and use these modules in your Python shell script without needing to use pip install commands in your code.\nSources\nUse external Python libraries in your AWS Glue job | AWS re:Post\nAWS Glue Visual ETL - Install/ import packages | AWS re:Post\nUsing job parameters in AWS Glue jobs - AWS Glue\nAWS Glue Python shell now supports Python 3.9 with a flexible pre-loaded environment and support to install additional libraries | AWS Big Data Blog\n\nDoes my Glue job need an internet access for this ?"
