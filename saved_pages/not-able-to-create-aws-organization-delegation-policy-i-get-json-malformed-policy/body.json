Looking at your policy, I can see a few potential issues:\nIn the \"Fully_manage_backup_policies\" statement, you're using \"RESOURCE_CONTROL_POLICY\" in the condition, but this might not be a valid policy type for AWS Organizations. The standard policy types include SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY, TAG_POLICY, BACKUP_POLICY, AISERVICES_OPT_OUT_POLICY, and others.\nThere might be trailing commas or formatting issues that are causing the JSON validation to fail.\nTo resolve this issue, I recommend the following steps:\nCopy your policy JSON\nConvert or validate it using the IAM policy editor:\nGo to the IAM console\nChoose \"Policies\"\nClick \"Create policy\"\nSelect the \"JSON\" tab\nPaste your policy\nThe editor will highlight any syntax errors\nFix the identified errors\nOnce the policy validates correctly in the IAM editor, copy it back to the Organizations delegation policy creation page\nCommon JSON syntax errors include:\nExtra or missing commas\nUnmatched brackets or braces\nInvalid policy types or actions\nIncorrect formatting of ARNs\nAfter correcting any syntax issues, try creating the delegation policy again. If you continue to have issues, you might need to verify that the policy types and actions you're using are supported for delegation in AWS Organizations.\nSources\nCreate a resource-based delegation policy with AWS Organizations - AWS Organizations\nResolve IAM permission errors in CloudFormation | AWS re:Post\nManaged policy \"AmazonS3FullAccess\" is not valid | AWS re:Post\n\nIt contains invalid JSON. It should not start with the symbol ` . Assuming that's not intended, the ending of the JSON policy is also incorrect.\n{\n            \"Sid\": \"Fully_manage_backup_policies2\",\n            \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n            \"Principal\": {\n                \"AWS\": \"123456789012\"\n            },\n            \"Action\": [\n                \"organizations:DescribeOrganization\",\n                \"organizations:ListAccounts\"\n            ],\n            \"Resource\": [\n                \"*\"\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\nLook at the ending, you basically, need to close all arrays and elements."
