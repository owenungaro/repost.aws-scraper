  "body": "When I press the Sign In Button in AWS APP-Studio the screen refreshes and a message appears ; \"Invalid client provided\"\n\nWhen you encounter the \"Invalid client provided\" message while trying to sign in to AWS App Studio, this could be related to authentication issues with IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS Single Sign-On). Here are some troubleshooting steps you can try:\nCheck if your SSO token cache might be corrupted. This is a common issue that can cause authentication errors. You can try deleting the ~/.aws/sso directory on your local machine and then attempt to authenticate again.\nEnsure you're using the correct sign-in URL. If you're using IAM Identity Center, you need to use the specific URL provided to you (typically in the format of\nhttps://your_subdomain.awsapps.com/start\n) rather than trying to sign in with your AWS account ID.\nClear your browser cache and cookies, or try using a private/incognito browsing window, as stored data can sometimes interfere with the authentication process.\nVerify that your device's date and time settings are correct and synchronized. AWS authentication is sensitive to time discrepancies.\nIf you're still experiencing issues, contact your system administrator as you may need an updated configuration or there might be permission issues with your account.\nThese steps should help resolve the \"Invalid client provided\" error when signing in to AWS App Studio.\nSources\nCommunity | Setting up Amazon Q in VSCode using IAM Identity Center\nOrganization user can only login with provided link? | AWS re:Post\nsignin.aws.amazon.com | AWS re:Post\nCant sign in with new AWS sign method | AWS re:Post\n\nDeleting and recreating the IAM Idendity Service helped"
