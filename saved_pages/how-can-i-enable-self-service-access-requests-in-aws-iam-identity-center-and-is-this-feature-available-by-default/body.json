You may consider to manually configure it in the IAM Identity Center console:\nSign in to the AWS Management Console using an account with administrative permissions.\nNavigate to IAM Identity Center.\nIn the left-hand menu, select Settings, then go to Access Requests.\nEnable the Self-service access requests option.\nConfigure approval workflows.\nSave your changes.\nOnce enabled, users will see a Request Access button in their AWS access portal for resources they\u2019re not yet assigned to.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/enable-identity-center.html\n\nIn the setting console there is no \"Self-service access\" option"
