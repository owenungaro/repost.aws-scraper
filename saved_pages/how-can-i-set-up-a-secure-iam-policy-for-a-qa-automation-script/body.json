  "body": "Hi AWS community!\nI\u2019m working on a QA automation script using Python that needs to access an S3 bucket to download test data. I want to write an IAM policy that grants only the minimum permissions necessary\u2014ideally s3:GetObject.\nCan anyone share a beginner-friendly JSON example of such a policy? I'd also appreciate advice on AWS best practices for securing automation scripts like this.\nThanks!\n\nHello.\nWhile developing a script, why not run the script using a fairly broad IAM policy, and then once you are able to analyze it with IAM Access Analyzer, generate an IAM policy and narrow it down to only the necessary permissions?\nFor example, you can start by using AmazonS3FullAccess, and then once the script is complete, you can use IAM Access Analyzer to create an IAM policy and narrow down the permissions.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access-analyzer-policy-generation.html\nAlternatively, you can use the reference IAM policies listed in the following document to gradually narrow down your IAM policies to only the actions you require.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-policies-s3.html"
