  "body": "Hi all, I transferred one of my domains to AWS, and it is stuck on the stage.\n\"Waiting for the current registrar to approve the transfer. This can take up to 10 days depending on the TLD and the current registrar. (step 7 of 14)\"\nIs there a problem? Can I speed this?\n\nWhen transferring a domain to AWS Route 53, the \"Waiting for the current registrar to approve the transfer\" stage (step 7 of 14) is a normal part of the process. This step can indeed take up to 10 days depending on your Top-Level Domain (TLD) and your current registrar's policies.\nThere's no direct way to speed up this process from the AWS side, as you're currently waiting for your original registrar to release the domain. However, you can try these approaches:\nContact your current registrar directly to ask if they can expedite the approval of the transfer request.\nEnsure you've completed all necessary steps with your current registrar, such as unlocking the domain and providing the authorization code correctly.\nCheck your email for any transfer authorization requests from your current registrar that might require your approval.\nIf you decide you no longer want to proceed with the transfer, you can contact your current registrar and ask them to reject the transfer request, as AWS doesn't provide a direct way to cancel an incoming transfer from an external registrar while it's in progress.\nIf the transfer has been stuck for an unusually long time, you might want to contact AWS Support under the \"Account and Billing\" category for assistance with your domain transfer.\nSources\nCancel domain transfer | AWS re:Post\nNew domain propagation takes more then 4 days | AWS re:Post"
