  "body": "If I share a model I created in SageMaker Canvas with other users, will they still be able to access and use the model even if my user profile is deleted?\n\nHello yeeun choi,\nWhen a SageMaker Canvas user who created and shared a model is deleted, the behavior regarding model access depends on a few factors:\n1. Model Storage:\nModels built in SageMaker Canvas are stored in Amazon S3 buckets\nThe models themselves remain in S3 unless explicitly deleted\nAccess to these models is controlled through IAM permissions\n2. Shared Access:\nIf proper IAM permissions are in place, shared users can continue to access the model\nThe model's functionality isn't directly tied to the original creator's account\nHowever, permissions need to be properly configured to maintain access\n3. Best Practices:\nTransfer model ownership before deleting the creator's account\nEnsure shared users have proper IAM roles and permissions\nDocument model details and access requirements\nConsider creating a service account for critical models\n4. Potential Issues:\nPermission configurations might need adjustment\nAccess to related resources might be affected\nModel monitoring and updates might require new ownership\nTo ensure continued access:\nReview and update IAM permissions\nTransfer model ownership if possible\nDocument model access requirements\nTest access after any account changes\nHope this is helpful!"
