  "body": "After running Automation I got all the reult percentages as Zeros. Could you please help me why I got that\n\nThe issue you're experiencing with all result percentages showing as zeros after running automation could be due to several reasons:\nDate Range: Ensure that the date range you're querying in your automation code matches the period where you expect to see data. The API is very specific about dates, and if you're using future dates or dates where no data exists, you'll get zero values.\nTime Period Formatting: Verify that your start and end dates are formatted correctly, typically in the 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.\nGranularity: Check if the granularity setting in your query (e.g., 'DAILY', 'MONTHLY') matches what you're expecting to see.\nData Availability: There can sometimes be a delay between when data appears in the console and when it's available via the API. If you're looking at very recent data, it might not yet be accessible through the automation.\nPermissions: Verify that the IAM role associated with your automation process has the necessary permissions to access the required data.\nFilters: Ensure that any filters applied in your automation query match what you're seeing in the console.\nTo troubleshoot:\nUse recent past dates where you know data exists.\nTry removing any grouping parameters to get overall utilization first.\nDouble-check your account and region settings.\nIf possible, run a similar query directly in the AWS CLI to see if it produces the same result.\nIf the issue persists after these checks, you may need to review your automation code in detail or consult with AWS support, as there could be an account-specific issue or a discrepancy between the console data and what's available through the API.\nSources\nGetReservationsUtilization API returning all zero values, but i check in console it has data and values | AWS re:Post"
