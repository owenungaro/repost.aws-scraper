  "body": "Hi,\nI chose to use Cognito Managed Login in my application because it seemed like the recommended and more hassle-free approach, compared to building my own authentication UI.\nHowever, I\u2019m facing a UX issue regarding email verification:\nIf a user signs up with an email but does not confirm their email, there seems to be no route or way for them to request a new verification code.\nIf the user tries to sign up again with the same email, Cognito returns \u201cuser already exists.\u201d\nIf the user tries to reset their password, Cognito says the email is not confirmed.\nAs a result, the user is \u201cstuck\u201d and cannot verify their account or proceed, unless they contact the app developer/admin.\nIs there a built-in solution, configuration, or best practice to allow users to request a new confirmation code in this Managed Login flow? Or is this a gap in the Managed Login approach that requires a custom workaround?\n\nIn Amazon Cognito, you can enable users to request a new verification code when they haven't confirmed their account through the ResendConfirmationCode API operation.\nFor users who have signed up but haven't confirmed their accounts yet, this operation sends a new confirmation code to their email address or phone number (whichever is set as an auto-verified attribute). The code is valid for 24 hours.\nIf you're using Cognito Managed Login, there are a few approaches to handle this situation:\nIf you're using Amplify Authenticator UI, you can customize the verification flow to include a \"Resend code\" option that calls the ResendConfirmationCode API when clicked.\nFor a more custom solution, you can implement a client-side handler that detects when a user is in the unconfirmed state and provides them with an option to request a new code.\nYou can also implement a post-confirmation Lambda trigger to create a more seamless experience after verification.\nWithout this functionality, users who don't receive or lose their verification code would indeed be stuck in an unconfirmed state, unable to fully access your application. They wouldn't be able to sign up again (as the account already exists) or reset their password (as the email isn't confirmed).\nFor administrator-assisted recovery, an admin can mark a user's email or phone as verified through the Amazon Cognito console by editing the user's attributes and checking \"Mark email address as verified\" or by setting the email_verified attribute to true using the AdminUpdateUserAttributes API.\nSources\nResendConfirmationCode - Amazon Cognito User Pools\nAuthenticator is not redirecting user to login page after account verification code is entered | AWS re:Post\nPasswords, account recovery, and password policies - Amazon Cognito\nConfiguring verification and invitation messages - Amazon Cognito\n\nFeature Request: \"Resend Code\" Button on Cognito Managed Login\nHello AWS Cognito team,\nI would like to request a much-needed feature for the Cognito Managed Login flow:\n- Please add a \"Resend Code\" button on the email/phone verification screen.\nCurrently, if a user does not receive (or loses) their verification code during sign-up, there is no way for them to request a new code directly from the Managed Login flow.\nAs a result, users are stuck in an unconfirmed state and cannot proceed or recover without developer/admin assistance, which leads to a poor user experience.\nMany competing authentication providers include this feature by default.\nThis addition would make the Managed Login flow much more hassle-free and production-ready, especially for teams who want to avoid building a fully custom authentication UI.\nThank you for considering this improvement!"
