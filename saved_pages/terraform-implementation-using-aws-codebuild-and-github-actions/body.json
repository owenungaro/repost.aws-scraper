  "body": "Hi,\nWe have an API stack built on Nodejs and a web app built using Reactjs (using the aforementioed API) ready go. It is all tested in the local docker environment. We are thinking of deploying the API using AWS Lambda/API gateway and have Amplify host the web app. We want to have 2 environments : (1) Staging - This will run in its own subaccount (2) Live - This will have its own AWS subaccount. Each environment has the db layer at MongoDB but we want to have it hosted rather than running in our own infrastructure.\nI need to create the infrastructure using Terraform. I planned to create a EC2 instance and install terraform and execute the terraform. But the requirement is to use Github actions along with the AWS CodeBuild in a Hybrid way.\nI am confused in implementing using AWS Codebuild and Github Actions ? Anyone can guide me  or give a  plan  in setting up the infrastructure for the above?\n\nTo implement your infrastructure using Terraform with AWS CodeBuild and GitHub Actions, you can follow this approach:\nStore your Terraform configuration files in your GitHub repository alongside your application code.\nSet up two separate AWS CodeBuild projects - one for the staging environment and one for the production environment. Each project should be associated with the respective AWS subaccount.\nCreate GitHub Actions workflows that trigger the CodeBuild projects. You'll need separate workflows for staging and production deployments.\nIn your GitHub Actions workflow:\nSet up the necessary AWS credentials using GitHub Secrets\nTrigger the appropriate CodeBuild project based on the target environment\nPass any required parameters or variables to CodeBuild\nIn your CodeBuild projects:\nUse a buildspec file to define the build process\nInstall Terraform\nInitialize Terraform and apply your configuration\nConfigure your Terraform backend to use S3 for state storage and DynamoDB for state locking. This ensures your state is securely stored and can be accessed across different runs.\nIn your Terraform configuration:\nDefine your Lambda functions and API Gateway for the API\nSet up AWS Amplify for hosting the web app\nConfigure the necessary IAM roles and policies\nSet up any required VPC configurations\nDefine your MongoDB Atlas provider for database hosting\nUse Terraform workspaces or separate state files for managing the different environments.\nImplement branch protection rules in GitHub to ensure that changes to the production environment go through proper review processes.\nThis setup allows you to leverage both GitHub Actions for workflow orchestration and AWS CodeBuild for the actual Terraform execution, providing a secure and scalable way to manage your infrastructure across multiple environments. Remember to properly manage your AWS credentials and sensitive information using GitHub Secrets and AWS Secrets Manager where appropriate.\nSources\nBuild and push Docker images to Amazon ECR using GitHub Actions and Terraform - AWS Prescriptive Guidance\nAutomate Microsoft web application deployments with GitHub Actions and Terraform | Microsoft Workloads on AWS"
