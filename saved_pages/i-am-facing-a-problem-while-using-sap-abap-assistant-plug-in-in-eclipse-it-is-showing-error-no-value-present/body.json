  "body": "\n\nI apologize, but I don't have specific information about an \"Error: No Value Present\" message for the SAP ABAP Assistant plugin in Eclipse. However, based on the general setup process for the SAP ABAP Assistant, I can suggest a few troubleshooting steps:\nEnsure that you have properly installed and configured the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) version 2 on your system.\nVerify that you have correctly configured the AWS CLI to authenticate with the AWS IAM Identity Center using the \"aws configure sso\" command.\nCheck if you have successfully authenticated with the IAM Identity Center by running the \"aws sso login --profile\n<profile-name>\n\" command.\nMake sure you have downloaded and installed the correct version of the SAP ABAP Assistant plugin for your Eclipse IDE.\nConfirm that you have properly configured the plugin within the Eclipse IDE.\nVerify that you have established connections between the Eclipse IDE and your SAP systems (whether they are hosted in an Amazon VPC, on-premises, or in the SAP Business Technology Platform ABAP environment).\nIf you've gone through these steps and are still encountering the \"No Value Present\" error, it might be helpful to check the Eclipse error logs for more detailed information about the issue. You may also want to consider reinstalling the plugin or reaching out to AWS support for further assistance.\nSources\nGuidance for Improving Application Development Productivity with the SAP ABAP Assistant on AWS"
