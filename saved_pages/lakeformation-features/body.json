  "body": "The lake formation pricing page mentions the following features: Storage API, governed tables, and storage optimizer.\nhttps://aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/pricing/\nI went through the documentation, but there is no mention of these whatsoever. I am very surprised, the AWS doc is usually very detailed.\nWhere can I find more info about those features?\nThank you\n\nAWS Lake Formation offers several key features that help manage and secure data lakes at scale:\nStorage API: This allows you to scan and filter data using Lake Formation policies. It's charged based on the number of bytes scanned (rounded to the next megabyte, with a 10MB minimum). To optimize filtering costs, you can store data in columnar file formats like Parquet and ORC.\nGoverned Tables: These are AWS-managed table types on Amazon S3. They're charged based on the amount of metadata in number of files tracked, API calls that retrieve or manipulate the metadata, and the number of bytes processed by the storage optimizer.\nStorage Optimizer: This runs in the background to optimize the layout of Governed Tables, improving query performance. You can manage storage optimization for governed tables using the Storage APIs.\nThese features are available in specific AWS regions, including US East (N. Virginia, Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo), Europe (Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Stockholm), Canada (Central), and South America (S\u00e3o Paulo).\nFor more information, you can explore the AWS Lake Formation documentation, particularly the sections on Storage APIs and governed tables. The Storage APIs documentation describes the StorageOptimizer structure and operations like ListTableStorageOptimizers and UpdateTableStorageOptimizer that allow you to manage storage optimization on governed tables.\nLake Formation also offers broader data governance features like centralized data permissions, simplified security management, data sharing capabilities, and compliance monitoring.\nSources\nAWS Lake Formation Pricing - Amazon Web Services\nStorage APIs - AWS Lake Formation\nData Lake Governance \u2013 AWS Lake Formation Features \u2013 AWS\nSupported Regions - AWS Lake Formation"
