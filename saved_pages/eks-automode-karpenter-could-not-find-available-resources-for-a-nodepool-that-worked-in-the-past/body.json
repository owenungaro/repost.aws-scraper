But at some point, it just kept saying this \"NodePool requirements filtered out all compatible available instance types\" for the past 25 hours\nI checked my quota.\nI have enough quota\n\nThe issue you're experiencing with your EKS Auto Mode nodepool not finding compatible instance types despite having sufficient quota could be due to several factors:\nInstance Availability\n: P4d instances are specialized GPU instances that may have limited availability in your region, especially for spot instances. Even with sufficient quota, the actual availability of these instances can fluctuate based on demand.\nSpot Capacity Constraints\n: Since you're requesting spot instances specifically, there might not be any p4d.24xlarge spot instances available at the moment. Spot capacity can be particularly limited for specialized GPU instances.\nRegion/AZ Limitations\n: Your nodepool might be targeting specific Availability Zones where p4d instances are currently unavailable. You might want to consider expanding your AZ selection if you haven't specified any.\nPrice Constraints\n: There might be implicit price constraints in the default NodeClass that are preventing Karpenter from provisioning these instances if the current spot price is too high.\nTo troubleshoot this issue:\nCheck NodeDiagnostic\n: Use the Kubernetes NodeDiagnostic resource to retrieve more detailed logs about why instances can't be found.\nReview EC2 Console Output\n: Use the AWS EC2 CLI command 'get-console-output' to get more information about any failed launch attempts.\nModify Your NodePool\n: Consider temporarily relaxing some requirements to see if instances become available:\nTry adding more instance families that have similar GPU capabilities\nConsider using on-demand instances temporarily\nCheck if there are specific AZ constraints that might be limiting availability\nCheck AWS Events\n: There might be capacity issues in your region for these specific instance types. Check AWS Health Dashboard or Service Health Dashboard for any relevant announcements.\nRemember that in EKS Auto Mode, AWS manages Karpenter for you, so you don't have direct access to all Karpenter logs. If the issue persists, you may need to contact AWS support for more detailed diagnostics, as they have access to the underlying Karpenter logs and infrastructure.\nSources\nHow to provision GPU nodes in EKS Auto mode type cluster | AWS re:Post\nEKS Karpenter nodeclaim error | AWS re:Post\nHow to debug Auto-Mode custom NodePool | AWS re:Post"
