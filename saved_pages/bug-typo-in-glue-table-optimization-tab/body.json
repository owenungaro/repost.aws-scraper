  "body": "Hi,\nOn the Table Optimization tab (AWS Glue > tables > [table name] > Table optimization > Optimization configuration), the IAM role field reads \"\nole\n/[role name]\" rather than \"role/[role name]\". There doesn't seem to be any issue with my role name in other pages in the UI so I'm assuming it's a bug.\nSee screenshot below.\nThanks,\nDavid\n\nCould you attach the screenshot of it ?\n\nThank you for reporting this issue with the display of IAM role names in the Table Optimization tab. This appears to be a UI rendering bug where the IAM role path is displaying \"ole/\" instead of \"role/\" in the AWS Glue console.\n\nThe actual functionality should not be affected by this display issue, as the underlying ARN structure is likely correct in the system. When you're configuring table optimizers like compaction, snapshot retention, or orphan file deletion, the system should still be using the correct role ARN format (arn:aws:iam::[account-id]:role/[role-name]) even if it's displaying incorrectly in the UI.\n\nI'll make sure this feedback is passed along to the appropriate team for investigation and correction. In the meantime, you can verify the correct role is being used by checking the AWS CLI output when you run commands related to table optimizers, as the CLI should show the complete and correct role ARN.\nSources\nTable optimization prerequisites - AWS Glue\nDisabling orphan file deletion - AWS Glue\nDisabling snapshot retention optimizer - AWS Glue"
