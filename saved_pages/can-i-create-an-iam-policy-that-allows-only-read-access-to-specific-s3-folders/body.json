  "body": "Can I create an IAM policy that allows only read access to specific S3 folders?\nI want to give someone access to a folder in my S3 bucket so they can view and download files\u2014but not upload or delete anything. Is there a beginner-friendly IAM policy I can use?\n\nYes, you can create an IAM policy that allows read-only access to specific folders in an Amazon S3 bucket.\nHere's a beginner-friendly approach:\nCreate a custom IAM policy that grants read-only permissions to a specific folder in your S3 bucket.\nThe policy would look like this:\n{\n\"Version\"\n:\n\"2012-10-17\"\n,\n\"Statement\"\n:\n[\n{\n\"Effect\"\n:\n\"Allow\"\n,\n\"Action\"\n:\n[\n\"s3:Get*\"\n,\n\"s3:List*\"\n]\n,\n\"Resource\"\n:\n[\n\"arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/folder-name/*\"\n]\n}\n]\n}\nThis policy allows:\ns3:Get*\n- Permissions to retrieve objects (download files)\ns3:List*\n- Permissions to list objects (view files)\nThe\nResource\nelement restricts these permissions to only the specified folder path\nTo implement this policy:\nSign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console\nCreate a new policy by navigating to Policies and selecting \"Create policy\"\nChoose the JSON tab and paste the policy above (replacing \"your-bucket-name\" and \"folder-name\" with your actual values)\nReview and create the policy with a descriptive name\nAttach this policy to the IAM user or role that needs the access\nThis approach is more secure than using the AWS managed policy\nAmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess\n, which would grant read access to all S3 buckets in your account.\nRemember that in S3, \"folders\" are actually prefixes in the object key names, so the trailing /* in the resource path is important to include all objects within that prefix.\nSources\nUse CreatePolicy with an AWS SDK or CLI - AWS Identity and Access Management\nAWS managed policies for Amazon S3 - Amazon Simple Storage Service\nControlling access to a bucket with user policies - Amazon Simple Storage Service"
