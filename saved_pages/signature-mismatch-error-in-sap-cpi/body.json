This can occur due to several reasons, even if the Canonical Request and StringToSign appear to be correct. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\nVerify credentials: Ensure you're using the correct Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for your AWS account. Even a slight mismatch can cause this error.\nCheck timestamp: Make sure the timestamp in your request is accurate and within 15 minutes of the AWS server time. Significant time differences can cause signature mismatches.\nExamine headers: Verify that all required headers, especially the 'host' header and any 'x-amz-*' headers, are included in the signature calculation. These headers must be in lowercase and sorted alphabetically.\nTrim whitespace: Ensure there are no leading or trailing spaces in header values. Convert any sequential spaces to a single space.\nURI encoding: Use the correct URI encoding for the canonical request. Some standard encoding functions may not work correctly for AWS signatures, so you might need to use a custom UriEncode function.\nSigning algorithm: Confirm you're using the correct signing algorithm (AWS Signature Version 4) and following the exact steps for creating the canonical request, string to sign, and final signature.\nLine endings: Check that you're using the correct line endings (newline characters) when concatenating parts of the canonical request and string to sign.\nMulti-value headers: If you have headers with multiple values, ensure they are combined correctly (comma-separated) in the canonical request.\nPayload hash: Verify that the payload hash (x-amz-content-sha256 header) is calculated correctly and matches the actual request body.\nLibrary version: If you're using an AWS SDK or library, ensure it's up-to-date, as older versions might not implement the latest signature requirements.\nIf you've verified all these points and the issue persists, you may need to implement a step-by-step debug process, comparing your signature calculation with AWS's expected calculation at each stage. This can help pinpoint exactly where the mismatch is occurring.\nRemember, even small discrepancies in how the signature is calculated can lead to this error, so meticulous attention to detail is crucial when troubleshooting.\nSources\nGetting \"SignatureDoesNotMatch\" from cloudfront | AWS re:Post\nCreate a signed AWS API request - AWS Identity and Access Management\nThe request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided.
