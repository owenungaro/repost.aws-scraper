  "body": "I'm experiencing a 502 error with my CloudFront distribution that was previously working fine. This is the\nsecond time\nthis has happened to me with a Google Cloud Run origin connected to AWS CloudFront. The issue seems to occur randomly without any configuration changes on my end.\nBackground:\nSetup: Custom domain \u2192 AWS CloudFront \u2192 Google Cloud Run service\nThis configuration was working perfectly before\nNo changes were made to CloudFront or Cloud Run configurations\nThis is the second occurrence of this issue with the same setup\nDiagnostic Results:\nSSL Certificate\n: Valid and properly configured\nIssued by Amazon (Amazon RSA 2048 M03)\nValid until 2027\nCorrectly includes domain in CN and Subject Alternative Names\nDNS Resolution\n: Working correctly\nDomain resolves to CloudFront distribution\nMultiple IP addresses returned from CloudFront\nOrigin Server\n: Accessible and responding\nDirect access to origin returns 200\nOrigin is a Google Cloud Run service\nNot blocking CloudFront IP ranges (tested with X-Forwarded-For header)\nWhat I've Tried:\nVerified SSL certificate validity\nConfirmed DNS resolution\nTested direct origin access\nChecked for IP blocking (origin accepts CloudFront IPs)\nThe first time I ran into this issue I could not resolve it after 5 hours of attempts. I ended up moving to a different Google Cloud account with a fresh server, which fixed it. I am now seeing the same issue appear in my test environment within my new GCP account.\nQuestion\nSince this was working before and the origin server is still accessible, what could cause CloudFront to suddenly start returning 502 errors? Has anyone else experienced this intermittent issue with Google Cloud Run + AWS CloudFront? Are there known issues or specific troubleshooting steps for this combination? I've been driving myself insane with this issue, so any suggestions are appreciated.\n\nA 502 error from CloudFront indicates that the service couldn't establish a connection with your origin server (Google Cloud Run in this case). Since this happened suddenly without configuration changes and has occurred multiple times, there are several potential causes to investigate:\nSSL/TLS Certificate Mismatch\n: Even though your certificate is valid, there might be a mismatch between the domain name in the certificate and the Origin Domain specified in your CloudFront distribution. The SSL/TLS certificate on your origin must include the domain name that matches either the Origin Domain in your CloudFront distribution or the Host header of the origin request.\nSSL/TLS Protocol or Cipher Incompatibility\n: CloudFront and Google Cloud Run might be using incompatible SSL/TLS protocols or ciphers. This can happen if Google Cloud Run updates its supported protocols/ciphers without notice.\nOrigin Connection Timeout\n: Your Google Cloud Run service might be experiencing intermittent delays in responding, causing CloudFront to time out while waiting for a response.\nOrigin Configuration Changes\n: Google Cloud Run might have made backend changes that affect how it handles requests from CloudFront, such as changes to request validation or header handling.\nNetwork Path Issues\n: There could be intermittent network issues between AWS and Google Cloud infrastructure.\nTroubleshooting steps:\nCheck Origin Protocol Policy\n: Ensure your CloudFront distribution is configured with the correct protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) to communicate with your origin.\nTest SSL/TLS Connection\n: Use OpenSSL to test the connection from an EC2 instance to your Google Cloud Run service to verify SSL/TLS handshake is working properly.\nReview CloudFront Logs\n: Look for specific error messages like \"OriginConnectError\" that might provide more details.\nCheck for Google Cloud Run Updates\n: Verify if there have been any recent updates or maintenance to Google Cloud Run that might affect external connections.\nAdjust Origin Response Timeout\n: Try increasing the origin response timeout in your CloudFront distribution settings.\nTest with Different Edge Locations\n: Check if the issue occurs consistently across all CloudFront edge locations or only specific ones.\nSince this has happened across different Google Cloud accounts, it suggests the issue might be related to how CloudFront interacts with Google Cloud Run specifically, rather than an issue with your particular configuration.\nSources\nHTTP 502 status code (Bad Gateway) - Amazon CloudFront\n502 - Bad Gateway : CloudFront wasn't able to connect to the origin | AWS re:Post\ncloudfront cache behavior causes 504? | AWS re:Post"
