  "body": "I can sign in to APP Studio, I have both roles (Adminand Builder) but if I create an App waiting for the AI prompt I get the \"401 Authorization required\"\nThe app is created , I can delete it but I can not edit it\n\nIt sounds like you're experiencing an authorization issue with AWS App Studio despite having both Admin and Builder roles. This could be related to service role permissions or IAM Identity Center configuration.\nSince you can sign in and create apps but encounter a \"401 Authorization Required\" error when trying to edit them, here are some potential solutions:\nCheck if the service roles for App Studio have been modified. Changing permissions for a service role might break App Studio functionality. Service roles should only be edited when App Studio provides specific guidance to do so.\nVerify your IAM Identity Center group assignments. As an Admin, you should have access to the Admin Hub with full permissions to manage applications. Make sure your user account is properly assigned to groups with the Admin role.\nIf you're using the AI prompt feature, try rephrasing your prompt. Sometimes the AI builder assistant may encounter errors that manifest as authorization issues.\nIf the problem persists, you might need to check with your AWS account administrator to ensure that your IAM Identity Center configuration is correct and that you have the appropriate permissions assigned.\nRemember that in App Studio, roles are assigned to IAM Identity Center groups, not directly to individual users. Each member of an added IAM Identity Center group will be assigned the role that is assigned to the group.\nSources\nTroubleshooting AI builder assistant and chat - AWS App Studio\nManaging access and roles in App Studio - AWS App Studio\nAWS App Studio and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) - AWS App Studio\nAWS App Studio concepts - AWS App Studio"
