  "body": "Hi,\nI am  learning aws features right now. I am implementing & testing services from aws. Yesterday i did upoad 2KB file in s3 bucket and even after giving all required permissions for user to create vector database by using OSS in aws knowledgebase was not created and process was going in infinite loop. many times this was happening i was doing search for solution and tring again n again but from aws no error message was coming to show me what is wrong in my process. twice they suggest some code to assign some role to user to assume and repeat the process, i did tried that even the OSS was not working well. this take my 4 hours to run n resolve the issue but it did not work as no proper error message was specified by aws. If permission error is there why aws console is not displaying it instantaly. Whole process i was doing from console only. At last when i gave admin access to user the OSS works and create kNowledgebase. Today i check my bill it is showing me 2.35$ for OSS usage charge. For creatining vector db of 2kb file while it is taking 4 hours and not showing an error just going in infinite loop. How can i figure out what is the issue here??? I did try Q developer suggestion and i was all correct as it specified. My concern is that if permission error from OSS why aws not specifying it instantly instead going in infinite loop. There is coding mistake in aws for this. For aws mistake i got bill of 2.35$ which as a learner i can not pay.\nPlease check into the issue with aws coding and resolve the billing charges as in first place it should not run for 4 hours to create vector db of 2kb file from aws.\n\nI understand your frustration with the OpenSearch Service issues you encountered. Let me address the key points:\nWhen creating an OpenSearch Service domain through the AWS console, permission errors can occur but may not always be clearly displayed. This is particularly common when setting up VPC access, where you need specific permissions like\nec2:DescribeVpcs\n,\nec2:DescribeSubnets\n, and\nec2:DescribeSecurityGroups\n. Without these permissions, the console may fail with an \"unauthorized operation\" error or, in some cases, appear to be processing without clear error messages.\nFor OpenSearch Service, proper IAM permissions are critical. The fact that your process worked after granting admin access suggests this was indeed a permissions issue. OpenSearch Service requires specific IAM roles and permissions to function properly, especially when integrating with other AWS services.\nRegarding the infinite loop and lack of clear error messages - this can happen when the service is attempting to perform operations but lacks the necessary permissions. Instead of failing immediately, it might continue retrying or waiting for resources that cannot be accessed.\nFor the billing concern, OpenSearch Service charges are based on the resources provisioned, not necessarily on successful operations. Even if your knowledge base creation was unsuccessful, the underlying infrastructure was likely provisioned and running during those 4 hours, resulting in the charges.\nTo troubleshoot similar issues in the future:\nEnsure your IAM user/role has all required permissions before starting\nCheck CloudWatch logs for any error messages\nConsider using AWS CLI which sometimes provides more detailed error messages than the console\nFor billing concerns, you can contact AWS Support directly as they may be able to provide a one-time courtesy credit for learning purposes\nAmazon OpenSearch Service is a powerful but complex service that requires careful configuration of permissions and networking to work properly.\nSources\nTroubleshooting Amazon OpenSearch Service - Amazon OpenSearch Service\nOpen Source Search Engine - Amazon OpenSearch Service FAQs - AWS"
