If so, it is best to contact AWS Support first for assistance. They could probably create another account that would have some privileges for the client to login.\nRegards, Brian.\n\nTry below on MFA recovery:\nTry Alternative MFA Methods\no\tIf the account has multiple MFA devices registered, use another one to authenticate.\no\tOn the AWS login page, select \"Try another MFA method\".\nRecover Root User Access\no\tIf your can access to the root account email, they can request a password reset.\no\tAWS allows identity verification using the registered email and phone number.\nContact AWS Support\no\tIf no alternative authentication methods work, your client must contact AWS Support.\no\tThey will need to verify ownership using company details and billing information.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_lost-or-broken.html"
