  "body": "Live Tail via AWS CLI\nHow do I stream CloudWatch Logs live via AWS CLI?\nI tried aws logs tail but get \u201cpermission denied.\u201d What CLI command structure or permissions are required to actively stream new log lines?\n\nTo stream CloudWatch Logs live via AWS CLI, you need to use the\nstart-live-tail\ncommand, not\naws logs tail\n. The Live Tail streaming CLI support was announced in June 2024 and allows you to view, search, and filter log events in real-time.\nHere's the basic command structure:\naws logs start-live-tail --log-group-identifiers \"arn:aws:logs:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:log-group:LOG_GROUP_NAME\"\nYou can also filter by specific log streams:\naws logs start-live-tail --log-group-identifiers \"arn:aws:logs:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:log-group:LOG_GROUP_NAME\" --log-stream-names \"stream1\" \"stream2\"\nImportant notes:\nThe Log Group ARN must be in the format shown above (replace REGION, ACCOUNT_ID, and LOG_GROUP_NAME with your values)\nYou can provide up to 10 Log Group Identifiers\nIf you specify multiple log groups, you cannot use the --log-stream-names option\nYou cannot use --log-stream-names and --log-stream-name-prefixes simultaneously\nRegarding the \"permission denied\" error, you need to ensure you have the necessary IAM permissions to perform the Live Tail operation. Make sure your IAM user or role has permissions to access CloudWatch Logs and specifically to use the Live Tail feature.\nThe Live Tail session can run in interactive mode (default) or print-only mode and can last for up to 3 hours. Note that Live Tail sessions incur charges based on usage time.\nSources\nstart-live-tail \u2014 AWS CLI 2.27.34 Command Reference\nTroubleshoot with CloudWatch Logs Live Tail - Amazon CloudWatch Logs\nAmazon CloudWatch Logs announces Live Tail streaming CLI support  - AWS"
