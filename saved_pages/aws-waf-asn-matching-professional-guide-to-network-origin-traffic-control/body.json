AWS WAF\u2019s ASN (Autonomous System Number) matching feature equips you with precise control over access to your web applications, enabling you to allow or block requests based on their network origin. This guide explains the feature\u2019s value, practical use cases, and provides a clear, professional walkthrough for implementation.\nUnderstanding ASNs\nAn Autonomous System Number (ASN) uniquely identifies a network on the internet, functioning similarly to a digital zip code for routing traffic. For example, AS16509 is Amazon network, recognizing these identifiers allows you to make informed and strategic decisions about which networks can interact with your applications.\nWhy Use AWS WAF ASN Matching?\nAWS WAF\u2019s ASN matching acts as a powerful filter for your web traffic. By leveraging this feature, you can:\n\u2022\tAllow or block traffic from specific networks or ISPs.\n\u2022\tRespond rapidly to malicious activity by blocking entire networks.\n\u2022\tRestrict access to trusted CDN providers.\n\u2022\tEnforce zero-trust security models with granular network controls.\nThis capability is particularly valuable when combined with other AWS WAF rules, enabling sophisticated, layered security policies.\nCommon Use Cases\n\u2022\tRegional Restrictions: Limit access to your application based on known ISPs within certain countries.\n\u2022\tThreat Mitigation: Block networks associated with suspicious or malicious activity.\n\u2022\tContent Delivery Optimization: Whitelist only approved CDN or partner networks.\n\u2022\tZero-Trust Implementation: Specify exactly which networks are permitted to access sensitive resources.\nStep-by-Step Implementation\nStep 1: Identify Target ASNs\n\u2022\tConduct thorough research to determine the ASNs you intend to allow or block. Utilize reputable tools such as Whois to obtain accurate ASN information.\n\u2022\tDocument all findings, including the rationale for targeting specific ASNs, to ensure traceability and facilitate future audits.\nStep 2: Access the AWS WAF Console\n\u2022\tLog in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS WAF service.\n\u2022\tInitiate the creation of a new Web ACL or select an existing one for modification.\nStep 3: Associate AWS Resources\n\u2022\tSelect the appropriate resource type (e.g., CloudFront distribution, Application Load Balancer) to protect.\n\u2022\tProvide a clear description and assign a CloudWatch metric name for monitoring purposes.\n\u2022\tClick \u201cAdd AWS resource\u201d to associate your selected resource with the Web ACL.\n\u2022\tClick \u201cNext\u201d\nStep 4: Initiate Rule Creation\n\u2022\tClick the \u201cAdd\u201d button to begin defining a new rule within your Web ACL.\n\u2022\tChoose \u201cAdd my own rules and rule group\u201d to create a custom rule.\nStep 5: Configure Rule Details\n\u2022\tAssign a descriptive name to the rule for easy identification.\n\u2022\tSelect the rule builder scope (e.g., regional or global) based on your application\u2019s deployment.\nStep 6: Define Statement Criteria\n\u2022\tSpecify the statement logic using AND, OR, or NOT operators to combine multiple conditions if needed, allowing for granular control.\n\u2022\tIn the \u201cInspect\u201d dropdown, select \u201cOriginates from an ASN in.\u201d\n\u2022\tEnter the target ASNs as a comma-separated list. Ensure each ASN is within the valid range (0\u20134294967295).\n\u2022\tSelect the desired action: Allow, Block, Count, or CAPTCHA. For initial deployment, \u201cCount\u201d is recommended to assess impact without enforcing the rule.\nStep 7: (Optional) Use JSON Editor\n\u2022\tFor advanced configurations, utilize the JSON editor to define the rule in JSON format. This approach provides greater flexibility and precision.\nStep 8: Finalize and Add the Rule\n\u2022\tClick \u201cAdd\u201d to include the rule in your Web ACL configuration.\nStep 9: Set Rule Priority\n\u2022\tIf multiple rules exist, assign a priority to determine the order in which traffic is evaluated. Higher-priority rules are processed first, ensuring critical controls are enforced promptly.\nStep 10: Configure Metrics\n\u2022\tDefine a metric name for monitoring rule performance via CloudWatch. This facilitates ongoing analysis and optimization.\nStep 11: Review and Deploy\n\u2022\tCarefully review your Web ACL configuration, ensuring all rule logic and associations are correct.\n\u2022\tClick \u201cCreate web ACL\u201d to deploy the configuration."
