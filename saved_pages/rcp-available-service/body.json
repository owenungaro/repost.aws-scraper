  "body": "I am looking to enable RCP in AWs organization, in AWS documentation it is said that Elastic container registry\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_rcps.html\nbut when I am applying it is said que ECR is not supported\n\nI think ECR is not supported in RCP even though documentation suggests it is. Maybe it's a plan for the future. I tried to create the RCP for ECR but ECR is not even listed in the Actions and the JSON for RCP complains.\n\nthis what I get from the console\n\nResource Control Policies (RCPs) currently apply to actions for a specific set of AWS services. According to the most recent documentation, RCPs support:\nAmazon S3\nAWS Security Token Service\nAWS Key Management Service\nAmazon SQS\nAWS Secrets Manager\nAmazon Cognito user pools\nAmazon Elastic Container Registry\nAmazon OpenSearch Serverless\nIf you're experiencing an issue where the system indicates that Amazon ECR is not supported when you try to apply an RCP, there could be a few possible explanations:\nThere might be a phased rollout of ECR support across different AWS regions\nThe feature might be very recently added and there could be a delay in its availability\nThere could be a specific limitation or requirement for using RCPs with ECR that needs to be addressed\nTo resolve this issue, I would recommend:\nVerifying that you're using AWS Organizations with the \"all features\" option enabled (not just \"Consolidated billing features\")\nChecking that RCPs are properly enabled in your organization\nContacting AWS Support for the most up-to-date information on ECR support with RCPs\nSources\nResource control policies (RCPs) - AWS Organizations\nIntroducing resource control policies (RCPs), a new type of authorization policy in AWS Organizations | AWS News Blog"
