  "body": "Hello, I need some basic advice. I am new to this and quite clueless. I am creating a simple platform where people can sell their files through me, like a marketplace. I want to maintain 100% legality and security on the platform itself, which is why I have opted for an S3 bucket, where I will store everything as files. and I will use Rekognition and Comprehend to scan each file for violence, nudity, and other important aspects of legality.\nIf one of my users accidentally uploads a bad, prohibited file and we fail to catch it in time, Amazon will most likely block our account, right? How can we protect ourselves, and are Rekognition and Comprehend sufficient services for a platform where verified users will be able to sell their files as zip, pdf, image, docs, csv, and others? Are there restrictions on the types of files that Amazon blocks, such as mp4, avi, and the like?\nAnd what else will I need besides Rekognition and Comprehend?\nThank you for your time and answers.\n\nTo protect your marketplace platform and prevent account issues, you'll need a comprehensive approach to content moderation and security.\nFirst, regarding your concern about account blocking: AWS doesn't automatically block accounts for prohibited content, but you are responsible for ensuring your platform complies with AWS's Acceptable Use Policy. Implementing proper content moderation is essential for maintaining compliance.\nFor content moderation, Amazon Rekognition and Amazon Comprehend are good starting points but may not be sufficient for all file types. Rekognition is excellent for image and video analysis to detect inappropriate content like nudity or violence. Comprehend helps with natural language processing to analyze text content. For a comprehensive solution, consider adding:\nAmazon Transcribe for speech-to-text conversion in audio files\nAmazon Textract for extracting text from documents\nAmazon CloudWatch for monitoring user activities and resource consumption\nFor S3 security best practices:\nEnable S3 Block Public Access at the account level to prevent accidental public exposure of files\nImplement least privilege access principles for all users and services\nUse bucket policies and IAM policies instead of ACLs for access control\nConsider encrypting data at rest and in transit\nSet up monitoring and auditing using AWS security services\nAdditional recommendations for your marketplace:\nEstablish clear policies with consequences for violations\nImplement fraud checks during user registration\nCreate a validation process for account registration\nUse a gradual access model that limits new users initially\nDevelop a comprehensive enforcement strategy with both automated detection and human oversight\nSet up an appeal process for users who believe their content was incorrectly flagged\nRegularly analyze policy enforcement data to improve your processes\nThere are no specific file type restrictions from AWS, but you should ensure your moderation tools can effectively analyze all file types you allow on your platform. For file types that cannot be directly analyzed by AWS services, consider implementing additional verification steps or restrictions.\nSources\nHow do I protect my free or trial services? | AWS re:Post\ncontent-moderation\nSecurity best practices for Amazon S3 - Amazon Simple Storage Service\nSecurity control recommendations for protecting data - AWS Prescriptive Guidance\nAmazon S3 Block Public Access - AWS"
