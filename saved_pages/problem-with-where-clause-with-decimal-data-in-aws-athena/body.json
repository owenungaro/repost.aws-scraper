  "body": "I am trying to run a query in AWS Athena with a decimal column (6,0), but the data does not return, even though the values exist. In the source database, the same query works.\n\nWhen working with decimal values in AWS Athena, there are specific considerations for how to properly use them in WHERE clauses.\nFor your case with a decimal column of type decimal(6,0), the issue might be related to how you're specifying the decimal values in your WHERE clause. In Athena, you should explicitly specify the DECIMAL type when using decimal literals in queries.\nInstead of writing:\nWHERE decimal_column = 123\nTry using the DECIMAL keyword with the value in single quotes:\nWHERE decimal_column = DECIMAL '123'\nThis explicit typing helps Athena properly compare the values. If you're using Athena engine version 3, it has stricter type validation compared to version 2, which might explain why your query works in the source database but not in Athena.\nAdditionally, ensure that your IAM role has the necessary permissions to access both the Athena service and the AWS Glue Data Catalog (specifically the glue:Get permission), as missing permissions can sometimes cause unexpected query behavior.\nSources\nHow to Display Decimal Values with 3 Decimal Places in Athena Table from Integer JSON Data Stored in S3? | AWS re:Post\nAthena Query Error using Python | AWS re:Post\nConsiderations for data types - Amazon Athena"
