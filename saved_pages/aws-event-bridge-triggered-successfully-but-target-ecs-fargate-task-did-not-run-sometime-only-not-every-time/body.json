  "body": "I can see eventbridge monitoring it has invoked successfully(did not went in dead letter), but the ECS cluster cannot see it got trigger, only today, it is triggering everyday\nHow to see the log of ECS task why it did not trigger, and what could be possible reason? and how to prevent?\n\nHello.\nDo you mean running RunTask from EventBridge?\nIf that is the case, an event will likely be recorded in CloudTrail, so search for the RunTask event in the CloudTrail event history and check the details.\nIf EventBridge is running, I think it will keep a history of API.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/tutorial-event-history.html\nSince this only happens occasionally, there should be no problem with IAM permissions.\nOne possible problem may be in the task settings.\nFor example, you may have selected multiple subnets in which to launch the task, and the selected subnets may include a completely private subnet that does not include a route to a NAT Gateway or VPC Endpoint, causing the task to fail to launch.\n\nhi,\nas you mentioned \"but the ECS cluster cannot see it got trigger\nonly today,\nit is triggering everyday\"\nbeside the above, can you check the rule's configuration\naws events describe-rule\nCheck the CloudWatch Logs group /ecs/your-event-triggered-task in the region. Look for logs from today to identify errors or reasons the task didn\u2019t start.\n\nhi again,\nto see the log in ECS cluster in Tasks tab- look under family\nyour-event-triggered-task\nif no tasks are listed for today, the issue is likely with the EventBridge trigger or cluster capacity, not the task itself.\nhope it helps!\nBest"
