  "body": "Hi I am in us-west-1, and I cannot access all the bedrock models. Thank you so much for your help\n\nBased on your issue with accessing Bedrock models in us-west-1, there are several potential reasons for this problem:\nRegional availability: Amazon Bedrock models are not available in all AWS regions. They are primarily supported in US East (N. Virginia) and US West (Oregon) regions. Some models have specific regional restrictions.\nModel access requirements: Even in supported regions, you need to explicitly request access to each foundation model you want to use. This is a separate process from setting up IAM permissions.\nTo resolve this issue:\nTry switching to a fully supported region like US East (N. Virginia/us-east-1) or US West (Oregon/us-west-2).\nIn the Bedrock console, navigate to \"Model access\" and request access to the specific models you want to use.\nEnsure your AWS account has the necessary permissions to use Bedrock (such as AmazonBedrockFullAccess policy).\nAfter requesting access, wait for approval. This process is usually quick but may take some time.\nIf you've followed these steps and still encounter issues, you may need to contact AWS Support as there could be an account-specific problem that requires their intervention. Some users have reported issues that were resolved only after AWS Support addressed problems on their end.\nSources\nBedrock Model \"Unavailable\" for all Regions | AWS re:Post\nAll Bedrock models are unavailable | AWS re:Post\nDifficulties Accessing AWS Bedrock Models from AWS lambda | AWS re:Post\n\"Invalid Model Identifier Error in Amazon Bedrock and Unable to Request Specific Models\" | AWS re:Post\nI can't activate LLM models in AWS Bedrock | AWS re:Post"
