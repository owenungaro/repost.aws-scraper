  "body": "Please see the above. Can you please help with this error? OpenSearch domain is publicly accessible (Quick Sight recognizes the domain), and I have updated Quick Sight Security permissions and added OpenSearch as data source.\nThank you!\n\nThe error you're experiencing with connecting Amazon QuickSight to your OpenSearch domain likely requires additional permission configurations. Even though you've updated QuickSight security permissions and the domain is publicly accessible, there are a few more steps to ensure proper connectivity:\nFirst, verify that the IAM policy for your OpenSearch domain doesn't conflict with the permissions in the\nAWSQuickSightOpenSearchPolicy\n. This policy needs to be properly applied to your AWS account to authorize connections from QuickSight to OpenSearch Service.\nFor OpenSearch domains with fine-grained access control enabled (which is likely your case based on the error), you need to configure additional permissions in OpenSearch itself:\nUse OpenSearch Dashboards to create a role (typically named \"quicksight_role\")\nAdd necessary permissions to this role, including cluster monitoring permissions and index-level permissions for reading data\nCreate a role mapping to associate this role with the AWS-managed IAM role for QuickSight\nMake sure a QuickSight administrator has properly authorized the connection to OpenSearch Service through the QuickSight security and permissions settings.\nThese steps should help resolve the connection issue you're experiencing. The error suggests that while QuickSight can see your domain, it doesn't have the proper permissions to access the data within it.\nSources\nUsing Amazon OpenSearch Service with Amazon QuickSight - Amazon QuickSight\nUsing OpenSearch permissions - Amazon QuickSight\nAuthorizing connections to Amazon OpenSearch Service - Amazon QuickSight\n\nThank you, I was able to connect yesterday using the same links."
