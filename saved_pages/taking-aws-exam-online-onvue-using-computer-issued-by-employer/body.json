  "body": "Hi team,\nIf the employer-issued computer passes the system test on the OnVue page, can it be used for the exam? Or could other issues arise during the actual exam?\nKind regards,\nCatalin\n\nIf your employer-issued computer passes the Pearson VUE OnVUE system test, it should technically be usable for the exam. However, there are some important considerations when using an employer-issued computer:\nAdministrative restrictions: Employer computers often have security policies, monitoring software, or restrictions that could interfere with the exam proctoring software during the actual exam, even if the initial system test passes.\nBackground processes: Corporate computers may have background processes or automatic updates that could disrupt your exam session.\nPrivacy concerns: The exam proctoring software requires access to your webcam, microphone, and screen, which might conflict with your employer's security policies.\nFor the most trouble-free experience, it's generally recommended to use a personal computer if possible. If you must use your employer-issued computer, consider:\nGetting permission from your IT department\nTemporarily disabling any security software that might interfere with the exam\nEnsuring no scheduled updates or maintenance will occur during your exam time\nLogging in 30 minutes before your scheduled exam time to complete the check-in process and address any last-minute technical issues\nRemember that you can begin the exam check-in process approximately 30 minutes before your scheduled exam time, not several hours in advance.\nSources\nNot able to see BEGIN exam option for upcoming exam| AWS cloud practitioner certification exam | AWS re:Post"
