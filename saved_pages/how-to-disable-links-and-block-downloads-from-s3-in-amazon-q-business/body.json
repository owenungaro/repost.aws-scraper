  "body": "In Amazon Q Business, is there a way to hide or disable the information source links (for example, S3 buckets) that appear on the chat interface when answers are retrieved from connected data sources? Additionally, is there a way to prevent users from downloading the objects even if they access the S3 bucket?\n\nThere isn't a built-in option to hide links from S3 buckets in the chat interface. You can adjust the queries or use custom formatting to prevent exposing the links in the chat responses.\nTo block downloads:\nUse IAM Policies to restrict access to only certain actions (GetObject without download permissions).\nSet a Bucket Policy to prevent downloading by restricting permissions for specific users.\nAlternatively, configure S3 Access Points for finer control over access."
