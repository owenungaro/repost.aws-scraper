I don\u2019t want to make the entire bucket public\u2014just one file. What are the exact steps to do this safely?\n\nHi, please try the following.\nFirst, ensure bucket settings allow public access:\nGo to S3 bucket\nClick on \"Permissions\" tab\nUnder \"Block public access\", make sure \"Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket or access point policies\" is OFF\nAlso ensure \"Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs)\" is OFF\nMake the object public:\nSelect the file in S3\nClick \"Actions\" dropdown\nSelect \"Make public using ACL\"\nConfirm the action\nVerify access:\nClick on the object\nCopy the \"Object URL\"\nTest in a new browser window\nImportant Security Note: Only make objects public if absolutely necessary. Consider using pre-signed URLs for temporary access or Amazon CloudFront for content delivery instead of making objects directly public."
