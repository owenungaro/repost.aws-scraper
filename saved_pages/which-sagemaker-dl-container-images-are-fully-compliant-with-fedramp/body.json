  "body": "Hi Team, I need some help here. IHAC needs to deploy an ONNX model using SageMaker. They scanned the latest Triton and DJL DL containers and found more than 1k vulnerabilities in different packages. The question is whether there are other SageMaker inference DL containers, including PyTorch based ones, that are 100% FedRamp compliant and ideally show 0 vulnerabilities?\n\nHittinh 100% may challenging, btw, may consider below:\nAWS Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) \u2013 AWS maintains a set of prebuilt SageMaker images, including PyTorch-based ones, that undergo regular security scans for vulnerabilities. However, even supported images may contain some vulnerabilities, and AWS recommends customers build and host patched versions in their own Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for high-security environments.\nFedRAMP Compliance Requirements \u2013 FedRAMP requires hardened images that meet security benchmarks defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). AWS DLCs are updated to address critical vulnerabilities, but organizations may need to apply additional security measures to meet FedRAMP standards.\nCustom Hardened Containers \u2013 If the latest Triton and DJL DL containers contain vulnerabilities, you might consider building a custom container using a minimal base image and applying strict security policies. AWS provides guidance on container vulnerability scanning and best practices for compliance.\nChecking Supported Images \u2013 You can review the AWS Deep Learning Containers GitHub repository to check available images and their security updates. AWS also provides a support policy for prebuilt SageMaker images.\n\nThank you Kidd for the answer. Can you specify which DLC images are FedRAMP compliant?"
